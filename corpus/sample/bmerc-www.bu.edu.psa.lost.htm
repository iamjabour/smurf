Server upgrade:
</b>
</font>
On 25 April 2001, version 2.4.2 of the
<tt>
psa-request
</tt>
server software was installed. The new software will allow us to add a
new analysis type at the start of May. As soon as new features are
introduced, they will be announced on the
<a href="">
<tt>
psa-request
</tt>
home page
</a>. We hope to complete these upgrades without any interruption in
service. Please contact us immediately if you experience any
difficulty.

Server outage:
</b>
from approximately 0900 EST on 23 March through 22:30 on 29 March
</font>
<br><br>
The
<tt>
psa-request
</tt>server went down for a protracted period because of a disk failure
on the machine on which it runs, which also happens to be the Web
server. The bad disk was replaced on 26 March, but it took three more
days for all of the software necessary to run
<tt>
psa-request
</tt>to be reinstalled. As of 18:20 on 27 March, starting from request
30051, the server resumed processing requests, but the Web choice for
returning results was disabled. Full Web operation was restored at
22:30 on 29 March, starting with request 30102, though there may still
be some lingering flakiness. We apologize for this inconvenience.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The
<tt>
psa-request
</tt>server is sometimes unable to return results to the user. This is
usually due to an error in entering the e-mail address; the Web
interface to the server has no way of checking that the e-mail address
it is given actually works, short of using it. These cases are noted
below with either "Host unknown" or "User unknown", depending on
whether the problem is in the host part of the e-mail address, or the
user name. (But the "Host unknown" case has become far rarer since the
Web submission page was upgraded to validate the host part of the
address on 25 August 1999.)
</p>
<p>Sometimes, even though the address is valid, the remote mail system
cannot accept messages, and delivery fails. This can happen for any
number of reasons, including user storage quota exceeded, server
resources exhausted, and various configuration errors on the remote
server. For an example of the latter, if
<tt>
mail.random.edu
</tt>
has been told to forward mail for
<tt>
"joe.user@mail.random.edu"
</tt>
to
<tt>
bio.random.edu
</tt>
, but
<tt>
bio.random.edu
</tt>
has been told to forward it to
<tt>
mail.random.edu
</tt>
, then
<tt>
joe.user
</tt>isn't going to be able to get mail messages from anybody until one
system or the other is told to accept them. These remote mail system
problems are reported with whatever explanation the remote mail server
gave for being unable to deliver the message, enclosed in double quotes
("), with any additional information enclosed in parentheses. If it
doesn't say "may still be delivered", then our mail delivery system has
given up, and you will need to resubmit the request once your sysadmin
has fixed the underlying problem.
</p>
<p>Another common problem is that the mail system may be temporarily
unable to reach the remote host, or the remote host may be overloaded
and unable to handle the connection. These problems are reported as
"Connection timed out" or "Connection refused," or even "Network is
unreachable." If the mail system indicates that it is still attempting
to deliver these messages, as it usually does in these cases, that is
noted with "may still be delivered" in the "Reported problem" column.
If the address is valid, the mail system usually succeeds sooner or
later, but such requests are still logged below because otherwise the
addressee has no way to tell whether delivery has failed temporarily or
permanently.

is submitted, either by mail or by Web interface, the mail server will
send an acknowledgement within a few minutes. If you do not receive
such a message (allowing for possible delay in mail delivery), that
means that either the server is down, or was unable to get the results
back to you. In either case, you should check this page.

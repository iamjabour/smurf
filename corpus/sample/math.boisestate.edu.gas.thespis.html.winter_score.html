I first read the libretto to
<i>
Thespis
</i>
, or
<i>
The Gods Grown Old
</i>sometime back in junior high school, at the very beginning of my
Gilbert and Sullivan indoctrination. Even then I would make up tunes
for the operas I didn't know yet. One such tune was, "Goodness
gracious, how audacious, earth is spacious, why come here?
<p>
That tune came back to me a whole career in music later when the idea of "completing"
<i>
Thespis
</i>
popped into my head.
</p>
<p>I knew that others had already tried it in a fashion suggested by
Sullivan himself: in later years, when asked whatever happened to the
score of
<i>
Thespis
</i>, he replied, half in jest, half in evasion, that he had saved the
tunes to use in other operas. Hence, would-be restorers have filled out
the libretto with tunes from lesser-known Sullivan pieces:
<i>
Haddon Hall, The Chieftain, The Zoo
</i>
, and so forth. I decided that the hard way was going to be the easy way: leaving the two surviving
<i>
Thespis
</i>numbers (the ballad &#8220;Little Maid of Arcadee&#8221; and &#8220;Climbing over
Rocky Mountain,&#8221;) as they were, all the rest of the music I composed
afresh, starting from scratch.
</p>
<p>
Shortly afterward, I read about the
<a href="http://www.wooster.edu/oh_lt_opera">
Ohio Light Opera
</a>in the British "Opera" magazine. The company -- rightly dubbed "The
Bayreuth of Operetta" -- could boast of having produced every one of
the Gilbert &amp; Sullivan operas, from
<i>
Trial by Jury
</i>
to
<i>
The Grand Duke
</i>
. I sent my score to James Stuart, Artistic Director of the company, half-joking that with
<i>
Thespis
</i>
now he really could make the boast. He called my bluff and slated the world premiere for the summer of 1996.
</p>
<p>I swiftly learned that this company knew its Gilbert and Sullivan.
With Jim directing, J. Lynn Thompson at the podium, Daniel Neer in the
role of Thespis, an enthusiastic cast, a wonderful orchestra -- well,
one cast member asked me, "do you always smile this much?"
</p>
<p>
May it make you smile too!

Game Highlights: By LINDEE HAND
<br ></br>
Chico?s dream of a long post-season drive in the Class A football playoffs came to an unexpected end in Bowie Friday night. The Dragons were hijacked by the Petrolia Pirates 19-3 in a bi-district showdown.
<br ></br>
Coach Don Hasley?s Dragons season ends with an 8-3 record. Petrolia will continue their playoff efforts with an 8-3 mark.
<br ></br>
The Pirates were led by two touchdown passes from quarterback Brent King to receiver Aaron Gee. The two connected on scoring plays of 8 and 17 yards.
<br ></br>
Meanwhile, Petrolia?s Ross Harrison was also in the spotlight. He kicked field goals of 17 and 23 yards and rushed 17 times for 153 yards.
<br ></br>
Petrolia never trailed in the game, jumping out to a 7-0 lead in the first quarter and then adding two field goals in the second quarter for a 13-3 halftime edge.
<br ></br>
The Pirates put the game away with a fourth-quarter touchdown.
<br ></br>
Chico?s only points came in the second quarter after the offense bogged down at the Petrolia 3-yard line. Colby Loper came on to boot a 20-yard field goal with 6:02 to go, cutting Petrolia?s lead to 7-3.
<br ></br>
But that would be as close as the Dragons could get against the Pirates.
<br ></br>
It marked the second win of the year for Petrolia over Chico. The Pirates knocked off the Dragons 34-21 in the third week of the regular season.

Game Highlights: By Mitch Word
<br ></br>
If football was compared to a three-legged sack race, the Bridgeport Bulls came up short Friday after losing two of its most powerful legs.
<br ></br>
The Bulls fell to Sweetwater 38-27 in a Class 3A Division II playoff contest at Tarleton State University Stadium in Stephenville.
<br ></br>
The loss to the Mustangs ended Bridgeport?s season at 6-5, but only after a gutsy performance from an offense hampered by the loss of running back Jesse Stowers. Stowers went out midway through the second period with a leg injury and never returned.
<br ></br>
However, Bridgeport quarterback Phillip Daugherty stepped up with a 253-yard passing performance.
<br ></br>
?Offensively, we played a great game. We had a lot of people stepping up and filling roles,? said Bulls Head Coach Danny Henson after the game.
<br ></br>
Eventually, it was the Bulls? defensive effort that failed to stop a Sweetwater running attack that amassed 275 yards.
<br ></br>
?We tackled poorly,? Henson said. ?Defensively we played too horribly to be out there. We had missed tackles, missed assignments, and gave up a lot of long drives.?

Game Highlights: By RANDY SACHS
<br ></br>
The Wichita Falls Coyotes, the state?s top-ranked Class 4A football team, ran into a Northwest High School Texan team that battled from the opening kickoff to the final gun in a bi-district showdown in Wichita Falls Friday night.
<br ></br>
The undefeated Coyotes moved up the playoff ladder with a hard-fought 28-14 win over the Texans. Wichita Falls is now 11-0.
<br ></br>
Northwest ends a successful season with a 6-5 mark. The playoff was the first for the Texans since 1989.
<br ></br>
?We never let up,? said Northwest Coach Terry Goode. ?If we had gotten a couple of breaks, well, you never know how it might have turned out.
<br ></br>
?Wichita Falls is certainly going to give a lot of people trouble ? they already gave our 11 guys plenty of it tonight.
<br ></br>
?Still, I was proud of our team. The defense hung in there and played tough. This is going to help build our program.?

Game Highlights: By Johnnie and Roberta Campbell
<br ></br>
The Celina Bobcats lived up to their reputation as a perennial high school football powerhouse. The two-time defending state Class 2A Division II champions crushed the Boyd Yellowjackets 38-0 in a bi-district playoff game Friday at Denton High School Stadium.
<br ></br>
?They got on us real quick. I don?t know if we were ready,? said Yellowjacket Coach J. G. Cartwright. ?We?ve had to play real hard to overcome adversity all season long.?
<br ></br>
On the first play of the game, Celina?s Josh Sharrock ran 74 yards for a touchdown and Grant May added the extra point. Less than three minutes later, Adam Harvey scored, this time on a 6-yard run to give Celina a 14-0 lead.
<br ></br>
Boyd came back, driving to the Celina 5-yard line with a 75-yard march behind quarterback Brian Harmon?s scrambling. But, the drive stalled and a field goal was wide right to end the scoring threat.
<br ></br>
Things went from bad to worse for the Yellowjackets as halfway through the first quarter they lost Harmon to an injury.
<br ></br>
The Bobcats scored again in the second quarter on a 21-yard run by Harvey and at half-time Celina led 21-0.

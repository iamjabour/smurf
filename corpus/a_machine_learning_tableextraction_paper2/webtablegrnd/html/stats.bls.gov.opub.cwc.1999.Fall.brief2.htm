Introduction

</p>
<p  align="justify">
The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ new National Compensation Survey (NCS) program completed its initial round of establishment-based surveys for 149 metropolitan and nonmetropolitan localities, enabling the publication of national
<a  href="#1a" name="1">

</a>
earnings estimates for many occupations. BLS systematically selected the survey areas to represent all of the Nation’s metropolitan areas and nonmetropolitan counties. BLS collected NCS earnings data between October 1996 and July 1998, with an average reference period of August 1997.
</p>
<p  align="justify">
The NCS program replaced the Occupational Compensation Survey program that provided limited occupational earnings data for a fixed (predetermined) list of survey jobs. The new program uses a sampling technique that produces a statistically representative sample of occupations for individual areas and the Nation.
<a  href="#2a" name="2">
<font  size="2">
<sup >

</sup>
</font>
</a>
From each sampled establishment a number of occupations, based on the establishment’s employment size, are randomly selected. This "probability selection of occupations" technique gives the more highly populated occupations a greater chance of selection. After selection, each occupation is classified into 1 of approximately 480 occupational codes that are part of the Census Occupational Classification System. This hierarchical system aggregates jobs into a number of broader occupational groups.
</p>
<p  align="justify">
The 1997 NCS covered establishments with 50 or more employees; the 1998 and 1999 surveys began phasing in establishments with fewer than 50 employees. The surveys include virtually every industry, except agriculture, private households, and the Federal Government.
</p>
<p  align="justify">
The types of data presented in the national bulletin are varied, ranging from the average (mean) hourly earnings of approximately 67 million workers covered by the survey ($15.09) to the average earnings of part-time janitors in State and local governments ($8.11).
<a  href="#3a" name="3">
<font  size="2">

</font>
</a>
Average hourly earnings of the nearly 15 million State and local government workers were about 24 percent higher than the average earnings of the 52 million private workers covered by the survey ($17.82 versus $14.39).

As shown in
<a  href="brf2tabs.pdf">
table 1
</a>
, workers are classified into three major occupational categories: White-collar, blue-collar, and service workers. These categories summarize several subcategories in the occupational hierarchy. For example, the average wages for a specific occupation, such as mechanical engineer, are published separately when publication criteria are met; data for mechanical engineers are also included in the succeeding higher level publication grouping, engineers, architects, and surveyors. This process continues through all levels—professional specialty, professional specialty and technical, and white collar. Finally, data for white-collar, blue-collar, and service workers are rolled into the total workers estimate.

Average straight-time hourly earnings of workers in white-collar occupations were about 50 percent higher than average earnings of blue-collar workers, and about double the average earnings of service workers ($18.59, $12.36, and $9.09, respectively). Within the white-collar category, average hourly earnings ranged from $11.53 for administrative support workers (including clerical) to $27.00 for executive, administrative, and managerial employees. The average hourly earnings spread among blue-collar workers was not as broad, ranging from $9.34 for handlers, equipment cleaners, helpers, and laborers to $15.86 for precision production, craft, and repair employees.

</i>
Full-time employees worked an average of 39.6 hours a week compared to 21.0 hours worked by part timers. The respective average hourly rates were $15.77 and $8.89. Full-time workers averaged $15.12 an hour in private industry and $18.20 in State and local governments; the range was wider for part-time workers in these two sectors, with hourly averages of $8.37 reported for part-time workers in private industry and $12.27 for those in State and local governments.

</i>
The average hourly earnings of unionized workers, $16.91, were considerably higher than those of nonunion workers, $14.56. Unionized workers in State and local governments averaged $19.74 an hour compared to $14.90 for unionized workers in private industry. Nonunion workers in State and local governments had hourly average earnings of $16.20, higher than the rate for unionized workers in private industry. The hourly rate for nonunion workers in private industry was $14.29. Readers should be aware that union-nonunion differences may reflect variations in the distribution of union members and other workers by occupation, industry, firm size, geographic location, and other factors in addition to coverage under collective bargaining agreements.

<p  align="justify">
Time versus incentive pay
</p>

</b>
<i >
.
</i>
The vast majority of workers covered by the NCS (about 97 percent) are paid on a time basis; no part of their pay is tied to an incentive or production payment. Average hourly earnings of incentive-paid workers were about a dollar higher than the average for workers paid strictly on a time basis ($16.21 versus $15.05).

. Average hourly earnings of private industry workers in the goods-producing sector (mining, construction, and manufacturing) were about 12 percent higher than earnings of workers in the service-producing industries (transportation, communications, and public utilities; wholesale and retail trade; finance, insurance, and real estate; and service industries). Hourly averages for the goods- and service-producing industries were $15.45 and $13.85, respectively. (NCS does not classify data for State and local governments by industry.)

Establishment size

</b>
. There was a strong correlation between earnings and establishment size. Average hourly earnings of workers in establishments with 2,500 or more employees ($19.32) were more that 50 percent higher than those of workers in establishments with 50 to 99 employees ($12.52).

The hourly rate for unionized workers in metropolitan areas was about $3 an hour higher than for unionized workers in nonmetropolitan areas ($17.32 versus $14.20). The average hourly pay gap between nonunion workers in metropolitan areas and nonmetropolitan areas was almost $4 ($15.25 versus $11.32).
<p  align="justify">
Although incentive-paid workers generally had higher average earnings than time-paid workers, in nonmetropolitan areas time-paid workers averaged $11.87 an hour compared to $10.74 an hour for incentive-paid workers.
</p>
<p  align="justify">
Average earnings in metropolitan areas ranged from $13.02 an hour in the smallest establishment category (employment size 50-99) to $19.34 an hour in the largest category (employment size 2,500 or more). The corresponding average hourly range in nonmetropolitan areas was $10.23 to $18.23.

The national bulletin for the 1997 NCS provides considerably more earnings information than shown in this article. It includes, for example, data for the 10 largest metropolitan areas and for the work levels determined for each job by using a "generic leveling" technique.

Part of the earnings difference is explained by the different occupational mix between private industry and State and local government. Highly paid professional specialty and technical workers, for example, accounted for about 40 percent of all State and local government workers but for about 15 percent of private industry workers.

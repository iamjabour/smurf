The recent focus on genetic resources has been directed toward the direct economic value of the resource, and this one focus has been echoed in the access and benefit-sharing provisions of the Convention on Biological Diversity. However, the scope of the benefits of maintaining genetic resources is much wider and includes the value of biological diversity to native peoples in social and cultural contexts, and to ecosystem functioning. Conservation and use of genetic resources appear to be in conflict. On one hand, the conservation of genetic resources is founded on the assumption that genetic diversity has value in itself as a basis for ecosystem health and is desirable for human existence, apart from its direct use. On the other hand, human population growth and the growing need for food security require the direct use and development of genetic resources in ways that often interfere with ecosystem functioning. Numerous strategies for conserving genetic diversity range from the preservation of germplasm in gene banks to in situ conservation and conservation through sustainable use. The value of these various strategies requires a realistic view of the costs and benefits of conservation and of its absence.

Contrasting views often exist between placing value on the use of individual components in an ecosystem and on maintaining ecosystem function. Within the CG system, the research scopes of the various Centres range from emphasizing specific components of an ecosystem as commodities for food security to valuing genetic diversity in the form of land races or in the form of unused, but supportive, components of an ecosystem. In the first instance, genetic resources sometimes are viewed as being separate from the ecosystem, but in the latter instances, biological resources are viewed as an integral part of an ecosystem. In the first view, land races of plants, for example, can be seen as stores of genetic variability to be exploited for crop improvement, but in the second view, they are seen as important components of a functioning ecosystem. The focus on genetic diversity as a commodity gives high value to genes and to the creation of highly productive genotypes either through selective breeding or directly through genetic engineering. In an ecosystem context, the value of genetic variability within a species is defined by its role in supporting complex interactions with other species.

In many farm communities, the value of genetic resources is similarly defined by the role of the resource in social and cultural systems, apart from its economic value as a commodity. Understanding these systems of values and the benefits perceived by the community will contribute to a better formulation of how genetic resources should be assessed and maintained. In other farm systems, commodity crops are deeply embedded in an ecosystem, and an understanding of the wider ecosystem dynamics is vital to the sustainable use of an ecosystems resources.

For example, a mixed crop-livestock system in the savannas of West Africa consists of sorghum, cowpea, trees, zero-grazed livestock, and grazing range. Soils are poorly developed in this area, so the interactions between key ecosystem components are crucial for providing nutrients for other components in the system. Therefore, major challenges in this system are to maintain or enhance soil fertility and to maintain a balance in inter- and intra-specific diversity. An additional challenge is to manage the system in view of social and cultural values, which include land-use rights, traditional preferences for species, market options, and the management of risk. Thus, the successful management of this system depends on focusing on the entire system and not just on its components. To achieve this goal, research and management strategies must build upon traditional knowledge of the system and on social and cultural practices and economic expectations among farmers, community leaders, development agencies, policy makers, economists, and biologists. The successful management of a system must consider such variables as soil fertility, inter- and intra-specific diversity, productivity, and human welfare.

The use of organisms in coral reefs also illustrates the need to holistically view a system. In many marine (and forest) ecosystems where harvested species are embedded in a complex ecological web, the productivity of harvested species depends on the maintenance of ecosystem services. Along with rainforests, coral reefs are amongst the most diverse ecosystems on earth and are often located along the coasts of developing countries. Coral reefs produce a rich variety of animals, including numerous species of fish and invertebrates that are harvested in subsistence and commercial fisheries. The establishment of no-take reserves in the South China Sea, for example, has produced recruits to areas outside the reserve and has led to the sustainable use of the reefs outside the reserves. Other examples exist in which the maintenance of high levels of biodiversity are essential to sustainable use.

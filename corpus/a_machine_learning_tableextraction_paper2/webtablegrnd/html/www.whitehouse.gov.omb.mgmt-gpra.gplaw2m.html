<a  href="#t1" name="h1">

SECTION 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES
</a>
.
</p>
<p >
(a) Findings.-The Congress finds that-
</p>
<p >
(1) waste and inefficiency in Federal programs undermine the confidence of the American people in the Government and reduces the Federal Government's ability to address adequately vital public needs;
</p>
<p >
(2) Federal managers are seriously disadvantaged in their efforts to improve program efficiency and effectiveness, because of insufficient articulation of program goals and inadequate information on program performance; and
</p>
<p >
(3) congressional policymaking, spending decisions and program oversight are seriously handicapped by insufficient attention to program performance and results.
</p>
<p >
(b) Purposes.-The purposes of this Act are to-
</p>
<p >
(1) improve the confidence of the American people in the capability of the Federal Government, by systematically holding Federal agencies accountable for achieving program results;
</p>
<p >
(2) initiate program performance reform with a series of pilot projects in setting program goals, measuring program performance against those goals, and reporting publicly on their progress;
</p>
<p >
(3) improve Federal program effectiveness and public accountability by promoting a new focus on results, service quality, and customer satisfaction;
</p>
<p >
(4) help Federal managers improve service delivery, by requiring that they plan for meeting program objectives and by providing them with information about program results and service quality;
</p>
<p >
(5) improve congressional decisionmaking by providing more objective information on achieving statutory objectives, and on the relative effectiveness and efficiency of Federal programs and spending; and
</p>
<p >
(6) improve internal management of the Federal Government.

"(6) describe the means to be used to verify and validate measured values.
</p>
<p >
"(b) If the Postal Service determines that it is not feasible to express the performance goals for a particular program activity in an objective, quantifiable, and measurable form, the Postal Service may use an alternative form. Such alternative form shall-
</p>
<p >
"(1) include separate descriptive statements of-
</p>
<p >
"(A) a minimally effective program, and
</p>
<p >
"(B) a successful program,
</p>
<p >
with sufficient precision and in such terms that would allow for an accurate, independent determination of whether the program activity's performance meets the criteria of either description; or
</p>
<p >
"(2) state why it is infeasible or impractical to express a performance goal in any form for the program activity.
</p>
<p >
"(c) In preparing a comprehensive and informative plan under this section, the Postal Service may aggregate, disaggregate, or consolidate program activities, except that any aggregation or consolidation may not omit or minimize the significance of any program activity constituting a major function or operation.

"(d) The Postal Service may prepare a non-public annex to its plan covering program activities or parts of program activities relating to-
</p>
<p >
"(1) the avoidance of interference with criminal prosecution; or

"(2) matters otherwise exempt from public disclosure under section 410(c) of this title.
</p>

</p>
<p >
"(b)(1) The program performance report shall set forth the performance indicators established in the Postal Service performance plan, along with the actual program performance achieved compared with the performance goals expressed in the plan for that fiscal year.
</p>
<p >
"(2) If performance goals are specified by descriptive statements of a minimally effective program activity and a successful program activity, the results of such program shall be described in relationship to those categories, including whether the performance failed to meet the criteria of either category.
</p>
<p >
"(c) The report for fiscal year 2000 shall include actual results for the preceding fiscal year, the report for fiscal year 2001 shall include actual results for the two preceding fiscal years, and the report for fiscal year 2002 and all subsequent reports shall include actual results for the three preceding fiscal years.
</p>
<p >
"(d) Each report shall-
</p>
<p >
"(1) review the success of achieving the performance goals of the fiscal year;
</p>
<p >
"(2) evaluate the performance plan for the current fiscal year relative to the performance achieved towards the performance goals in the fiscal year covered by the report;
</p>
<p >
"(3) explain and describe, where a performance goal has not been met (including when a program activity's performance is determined not to have met the criteria of a successful program activity under section 2803(b)(2))-
</p>
<p >
"(A) why the goal was not met;
</p>
<p >
"(B) those plans and schedules for achieving the established performance goal; and
</p>
<p >
"(C) if the performance goal is impractical or infeasible, why that is the case and what action is recommended; and
</p>
<p >
"(4) include the summary findings of those program evaluations completed during the fiscal year covered by the report.

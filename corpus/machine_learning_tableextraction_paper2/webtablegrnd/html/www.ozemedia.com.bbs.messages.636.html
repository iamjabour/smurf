I'm not expert on this..I'm on a steep learning curve with all the complications of setting up my own affiliate program.

But can't you use IP tracking?

: My partner and I have some software we are going to release as a shareware product. We want to set up an affiliate program for sales. From what I've read, there is some affiliate software for shareware that will store a cookie upon first visit ( the download) and recognize the visitor on a future visit (the purchase). The tracking software then makes sure the appropriate party gets their commission.
</p>
<p >
: My problem is this: Our software is privacy software, it shows average surfers where thier cookies are kept and allows them to delete ones they don't want. People can potentially delete the cookies placed by the affiliate tracking software.
</p>
<p >
: Any ideas? Thanks in advance.

<br ></br>
EARNINGS PER SHARE UP 35% - REVENUES ADVANCE 17%

<em >
New York, N.Y., June 22, 2000
</em>
- John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., (NYSE:JWa) (NYSE:JWb)announced today that earnings per share for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2000, advanced 35% to $0.81 per diluted share compared with $0.60 per diluted share in the prior year. Net income of $52.4 million increased 32% over the prior year. The company's operating margin reached 15% in fiscal 2000, or 18% excluding the amortization of intangibles.
</p>
<p >
Revenues for the year increased 17% to $594.8 million compared with $508.4 million in the prior year. Revenue growth was 8% year over year, excluding the current year acquisitions and the foreign exchange translation effects of weaker European currencies.
</p>
<p >
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, earnings per diluted share increased 30% to $0.13 compared with $0.10 in the prior year period. Net income of $8.2 million for the fourth quarter increased 26% over the same prior year period. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000, revenues of $149.1 million were up 20% over the prior year's $124.7 million.
</p>
<p >
Revenue and income gains for the year reflect improvement in all of the company's businesses. The company continued to gain market share through a combination of organic growth, as well as the successful integration of the acquisitions completed during the current fiscal year. Current year acquisitions exceeded our expectations and were accretive to earnings by $0.03 per diluted share.
</p>
<p >
The company continued its active share repurchase program during the fourth quarter acquiring over 500,000 shares. During fiscal 2000, the company acquired over 2 million shares at an average price of $15.74.
</p>

Segment Highlights
</u>
</b>
</p>
<p >
The domestic professional/trade segment registered a 36% increase in revenues over the prior year, led by the current year acquisitions, including Jossey-Bass, a San Francisco-based professional publisher, and the J.K. Lasser tax and financial guides. The increase in revenues was also attributable to the continued growth in sales through online accounts and strong frontlist titles.
</p>
<p >
Domestic college revenues advanced 30% for the year driven by a strong frontlist and the current year acquisition of approximately 60 titles from Pearson. Domestic scientific, technical and medical (STM) revenues increased 5% for the year.
</p>
<p >
International results were strong across the board. European operating results reflect healthy gains in STM journals, although revenues were somewhat depressed due to the strong U.S. dollar. The Canadian and Australian businesses delivered strong performances, while Asia's results improved significantly as the economy continued to strengthen.
</p>
<p >
?The company's performance during this past fiscal year was outstanding, both in terms of our financial results and the strategic initiatives that are driving Web-enabled revenue growth,? said William J. Pesce, President and Chief Executive Officer. ?We achieved a 15% operating margin, one year ahead of plan, while continuing to invest in the future through internal development and acquisitions. The two major acquisitions completed during the year were successfully integrated and delivered results that exceeded our initial expectations.?
</p>
<p >
He concluded by saying, ?Our results reflect Wiley's determination not to be limited by
<i >
either/or
</i>
thinking. Our future is not about digital
<i >
or
</i>
print products. It is not about quality
<i >
or
</i>
profits. It is not about content
<i >
or
</i>
distribution. Our future is about the powerful combination of all these things. We are enthusiastic about our ability to drive Web-enabled revenue growth by making Wiley's deep reservoir of ?must-have? content more easily accessible to our customers, while continuing to deliver strong financial results.?

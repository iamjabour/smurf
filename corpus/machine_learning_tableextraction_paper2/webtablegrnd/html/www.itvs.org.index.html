&lt;h2&gt;
ITVS - The Independent Television Service provides funding for
production of Public TV films
&lt;/h2&gt;
Public Television programs by Independent Filmmakers
 &lt;p&gt;
ITVS was established by Congress to fund and present programs that take
creative risks, advance issues and represent points of view not usually
seen on television. ITVS is committed to programming which addresses
the

needs of underserved audiences, particularly minorities and children.
Granting artistic control to independent filmmakers, ITVS solicits
funds,
packages, promotes and distributes work for broadcast primarily on
American public television.  ITVS seeks proposals which increase
diversity
on public television and present a range of subjects, viewpoints and
forms
that complement and challenge existing public television offerings.
&lt;p&gt;
On the ITVS website you can learn more about award winning program
offerings such as Forgotten Fires,  A Letter Without Words, Kontum
Diary:
The Journey Home, The Farmers Wife, and Travis.

The overall goal of this collaborative project was to identify, develop, and evaluate the suitability of new or underutilized plant or animal protein sources as replacements for high-quality fish meal in diets of post-juvenile salmonids. The specific objectives were: (1) to determine the levels of either poultry by-product meal or processed rapeseed protein concentrate in feeds that can provide high nutritive value and palatability; (2) to develop an in vitro assay to quantitate protein digestibility of salmonid diets; (3) to determine the processing conditions required to thermally inactivate selected fish pathogens in model systems, in acid-preserved silage, and in enzymatically hydrolyzed fish by-products; (4) to evaluate the protein quality and digestibility of fish meal products prepared by various methods; and (5) to measure the effects of fermentation and co-drying on the nutritive value of feeds containing combinations of alternate protein sources. Results indicate that alternate protein sources can successfully replace a significant portion of traditional high-quality fish meal in feeds for salmonids.

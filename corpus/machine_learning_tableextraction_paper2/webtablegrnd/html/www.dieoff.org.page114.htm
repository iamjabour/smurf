Roughly 43 percent of Earth's terrestrial vegetated surface has diminished capacity to supply benefits to humanity because of recent, direct impacts of land use. This represents an ~10 percent reduction in potential direct instrumental value (PDIV), defined as the potential to yield direct benefits such as agricultural, forestry, industrial, and medicinal products. If present trends continue, the global loss of PDIV could reach ~20 percent by 2020. From a biophysical perspective, recovery of ~5 percent of PDIV is feasible over the next 25 years. Capitalizing on natural recovery mechanisms is urgently needed to prevent further irreversible degradation and to retain the multiple values of productive land.

Rehabilitation of the world's degraded lands is important for several reasons. First, increasing crop yields is crucial to meeting the needs of the growing human population (1) for food, feed, biomass energy, fiber, and timber (in the absence of a massive increase in the equity of global resource distribution (2). Second, anthropogenic changes in land productivity have deleterious impacts on major biogeochemical cycles that regulate greenhouse gas fluxes and determine Earth's total energy balance (3). Third, biodiversity preservation depends, in part, on increasing yields on human-dominated land to alleviate pressure to convert remaining natural habitat (4). And fourth, land is frequently a limiting factor of economic output, and its degradation threatens to undermine economic development in poor nations (5, 6) and social stability globally (7).
</font>
</p>
<p >
<font  face="Comic" ms="#DEFAULT" sans="#DEFAULT">
Here I estimate the rate at which potential direct instrumental value (PDIV) could be restored to degraded lands from a biophysical (as opposed to socioeconomic) perspective. PDIV is the capacity of land to supply humanity with direct benefits only, such as agricultural, forestry, industrial; and medicinal products. It does not incorporate indirect values [for example, ecosystem services (8)], option values, or nonuse values (9) and is thus a conservative measure of value. PDIV is not the same as potential net primary production (NPP), and may even vary inversely with it; for example, average NPP in agricultural systems is typically lower (and DIV higher) than in the natural systems they replace (10).
<i ></i>
Because PDIV depends on complex and variable factors such as human knowledge and preferences, it is impossible to quantify precisely.
</font>
</p>
<p >
<font  face="Comic" ms="#DEFAULT" sans="#DEFAULT">
Below I make rough approximations of changes in PDIV on the basis of global surveys of human-induced land degradation. Case histories of recovery from natural or human-induced disturbance are reviewed in order to derive estimates of the time required to restore PDIV to presently degraded lands. Finally, potentially illuminating projections are offered of future changes in PDIV.

Global Extent and Severity of Land Degradation
</font>
</h2>
<p >
<font  face="Comic" ms="#DEFAULT" sans="#DEFAULT">
Land degradation refers to a reduction in the capacity of land to supply benefits to humanity. It results from an intricate nexus of social, economic, cultural, political, and biophysical forces operating across a broad spectrum of time and spatial scales (11).
<i ></i>
Here I consider only the biophysical agents of degradation that trace directly to human land use since 1945, although other proximate biophysical agents, such as air pollution (12), stratospheric ozone depletion (13), and climate change (14), are also important.
</font>
</p>
<p >
<font  face="Comic" ms="#DEFAULT" sans="#DEFAULT">
The geographic distribution of degraded land is poorly documented; even less well documented is the severity of degradation, which is typically judged qualitatively (15). The onset of degradation is often masked by intensification of land use that compensates, in the short run, for declines in the natural underpinnings of productivity; however, intensification usually exacerbates degradation, as do natural positive feedbacks (such as the concentration of soil resources by shrubs) (16). Global assessments have been undertaken of degradation of soils (in all biomes), drylands, and tropical forest lands.
</font>
</p>
<p >
<font  face="Comic" ms="#DEFAULT" sans="#DEFAULT">
<i >
Soil degradation.
</i>
The extent of soil degradation induced by human activity since 1945 was evaluated as ~2 billion ha, or 17% of Earth's vegetated land, in a recent study sponsored by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) (17). Of this, ~750 million ha (38%) are classified as lightly degraded (defined as exhibiting a small decline in agricultural productivity and retaining full potential for recovery); ~910 million ha (46%) are moderately degraded (exhibiting a great reduction in agricultural productivity; amenable to restoration only through considerable financial and technical investment); ~300 million ha (15%) are severely degraded (offering no agricultural utility under local management systems; reclaimable only with major international assistance); and ~9 million ha (0.5%) are extremely degraded (incapable of supporting agriculture and unreclaimable).
</font>
</p>
<p >
<font  face="Comic" ms="#DEFAULT" sans="#DEFAULT">
The percent of area affected seems regionally to be independent of ecological zone or economic status; for example, it is 20%, 22%, and 23% in Asia, Africa, and Europe, respectively. The direct causes of these forms of degradation (and estimates of the relative importance of each) are overgrazing (35%), deforestation (30%), other agricultural activities (28%), overexploitation for fuel wood (7%), and bioindustrial activities (1%). Global rates of change in soil degradation are unknown. The UNEP study constitutes the first standardized global assessment and is the baseline for planned future monitoring on a decadal basis.
</font>
</p>
<p >
<font  face="Comic" ms="#DEFAULT" sans="#DEFAULT">
<i >
Drylands degradation.
</i>
UNEP has also carried out a series of generally accepted global assessments of desertification (15). In the most recent assessment, desertification refers to land degradation in arid, semiarid, and dry subhumid areas (hereafter called drylands) resulting mainly from adverse human impact (18). Desertification is distinct from natural oscillations of vegetation productivity that occur at desert fringes (19); hyperarid deserts are not considered to be at risk of desertification and are excluded from assessments thereof (18).
</font>
</p>
<p >
<font  face="Comic" ms="#DEFAULT" sans="#DEFAULT">
The total decertified drylands area amounts to ~3.6 billion ha, or 70% of global drylands area (excluding hyperarid regions). Roughly 2.6 billion ha thereof exhibit no soil degradation, but have reduced crop yields, livestock forage, and woody biomass for fuel and building material (20). Of rangelands, which make up 88% of the drylands area, ~1.223 billion ha (27%) are degraded slightly or not at all; ~1.267 billion ha (28%) are moderately degraded; ~1.984 billion ha (44%) are severely degraded; and ~72 million ha (1.6%) are very severely degraded. Degradation classes are roughly comparable with those defined in the soil survey, and the principal direct causes of degradation are the same ( 18, 21). The rate of abandonment of drylands due to degradation is probably ~9 to 11 million ha year-1 (22). Rates of degradation seem to be accelerating, particularly in developing nations (23).
</font>
</p>
<p >
<font  face="Comic" ms="#DEFAULT" sans="#DEFAULT">
<i >
Tropical moist forest degradation.
</i>
Land degradation in tropical moist forest afflicts ~427 million ha (24). The present global annual rate of tropical forest clearing (defined as depletion of forest cover to less than 10% in all types of tropical forest) is ~15.4 million ha year-1 (25) and is projected to accelerate (26, 27). In addition, an area of roughly equal size is disrupted, but not cleared outright, through selective logging and shifting cultivation (26). The extent to which clearing and disruption precipitate land degradation is unknown. Rates of abandonment of recently cleared areas, especially in hilly or mountainous regions, of as high as 75 to 100% are indicative of one extreme (26, 28). In general, probably only ~50% of the tropical forest land cleared each year expands the area yielding agricultural benefits, whereas the other half replaces abandoned lands (29).
</font>
</p>
<p >
<font  face="Comic" ms="#DEFAULT" sans="#DEFAULT">
<i >
Total degraded area.
</i>
As a crude but conservative estimate of the total degraded area, I use the sum of (i) areas affected by soil degradation, (ii) drylands with vegetation degradation but no soil degradation, and (iii) degraded tropical moist forest lands, that is, ~5.0 billion ha (30). This amounts to ~43% of Earth's vegetated surface.

Time Required to Restore PDIV
</font>
</h3>
<p >
<font  face="Comic" ms="#DEFAULT" sans="#DEFAULT">
There have been few attempts to rehabilitate degraded land on a large scale. Possible rates of recovery can be inferred from studies of succession on land that has experienced volcanic eruption, shifting cultivation, continuous agricultural production followed by abandonment, or reclamation. The time required to restore PDIV varies tremendously with ecosystem type, history and spatial pattern of land use, the degree of alteration of climatic factors, and the types of benefits ultimately desired -- those derived from crop cultivation as compared to those derived from extractive exploitation of natural vegetation, for example.
</font>
</p>
<p >
<font  face="Comic" ms="#DEFAULT" sans="#DEFAULT">
<i >
Volcanic eruption.
</i>
Following volcanic eruption, the regeneration of lost top- and subsoil may be the limiting process with respect to time and difficulty of rehabilitation. At one extreme, the rate of topsoil formation is especially rapid on volcanic ash; a mere 100 years after the 1883 eruption of Krakatau, for example, soil 25 cm deep had formed on a daughter island, Rakata (31). More typical soil formation rates are ~1 cm per 100 to 400 years, however. At such rates it takes ~3000 to 12,000 years to develop sufficient soil to form productive land (32).
</font>
</p>
<p >
<font  face="Comic" ms="#DEFAULT" sans="#DEFAULT">
Rates of colonization and succession are comparatively swift in the absence of natural impediments (33). Rakata serves as a model for the recovery of a presumably sterilized site 40 km from species source pools (34). Many generalist groups with high dispersal capabilities became reestablished during the first 50 years after eruption. However, important taxa with lower dispersal capabilities, more specialized resource requirements, or higher trophic positions remain poorly represented even today (35). Similarly, 23 vascular plant species were present on Surtsey two decades after its birth (of 450 on the Iceland mainland 35 km away), but only a few had become widely established (36).
</font>
</p>
<p >
<font  face="Comic" ms="#DEFAULT" sans="#DEFAULT">
<i >
Shifting cultivation.
</i>
Shifting (swidden) cultivation generally involves slashing and burning of forest patches to create temporary fields that are harvested in a rotation between brief periods of cultivation and longer periods of fallowing. Cultivation typically lasts 1 to 3 years, during which a combination of declining soil fertility, competition from weeds, and pest or pathogen outbreak conspires to diminish yields sharply (37). The plot is then left fallow. Longterm studies of recovery of productive potential in swidden systems are few (38), but fallow periods required to make a system sustainable are ~20 years (ranging between 5 and 40 years) in the humid tropics and may be considerably longer elsewhere (39).
</font>
</p>
<p >
<font  face="Comic" ms="#DEFAULT" sans="#DEFAULT">
<i >
Abandoned cropland and pasture.
</i>
Rates and paths of natural succession vary widely on abandoned land formerly under continuous agricultural production. The chief commonality is the nonlinear relation between the intensity and duration of land use and the time required for recovery after abandonment. Factors influencing succession on old-fields (land abandoned after some combination of cropping and pasturing) are extremely complex, but the severity of erosion, initial floristic composition, and character of the ex situ seed source are paramount (40). In some areas, initial reestablishment of climax species was observed after 40 years of abandonment; in contrast, highly eroded fields experienced little succession during that period (41).
</font>
</p>
<p >
<font  face="Comic" ms="#DEFAULT" sans="#DEFAULT">
The conversion to pasture of up to ~43 million ha of Amazon rain forest over the past three decades (42) caused rapid declines in productivity and land abandonment after only 4 to 8 years of use (43). Extrapolation of rates of biomass accumulation and succession over 8 years since abandonment suggests that sites with a history of light use (20% of now-abandoned pasture) could reach forest stature in 100 years, those of moderate use (~70%) in 200 years, and those of heavy use (less than 10%) in 500 years or more (44). These estimates assume no further human impact. In many situations worldwide, recovery of productivity on abandoned land is prevented by burning (45) or episodic human exploitation of regrowth as it occurs.
</font>
</p>
<p >
<font  face="Comic" ms="#DEFAULT" sans="#DEFAULT">
Even without continued human disruption, however, regrowth of forest may not occur at all (as in the case of fire-climax grasslands (46, 47). For example, an agricultural area of ~3.5 million hectares in eastern Amazonia that was abandoned in the early part of this century had little vegetation aside from scrub and brush 50 years later (48). In India, trees have failed to establish in abandoned, decertified areas adjacent to sacred forest groves despite ample seed sources (49).
</font>
</p>
<p >
<font  face="Comic" ms="#DEFAULT" sans="#DEFAULT">
<i >
Reclamation.
</i>
Experience in reclamation of degraded areas, although limited, indicates unequivocally that human intervention may be effective (even essential) in ensuring a path and rate of succession that would achieve substantive improvements at time scales relevant to society (50). The potential for accelerating recovery is difficult to assess, as most degraded areas with known histories have not yet recovered. Moreover, recovery is nonlinear (with respect to time), and intervention can only accelerate some phases of the process.
</font>
</p>
<p >
<font  face="Comic" ms="#DEFAULT" sans="#DEFAULT">
Where land is suited to direct human use and has not been stripped of topsoil, substantial recovery may be achieved in as few as 3 to 5 years with intensive management (51) but more typically may take 20 years (52). However, recovery of self-sustaining, mature ecosystems in areas unsuited for intensive agriculture may take 100 years or more.

Projections of Future Land Productivity
</font>
</h3>
<p >
<font  face="Comic" ms="#DEFAULT" sans="#DEFAULT">
Despite great uncertainties, I venture crude estimates of the present global loss of PDIV and possible future changes therein. The light, moderate, severe, and extreme degradation classes are assumed to correspond to a residual PDIV of 90%, 75%, 50%, and 0%, respectively (Table 1, column 1). These values are conservative in that severely (as well as extremely) degraded land is generally abandoned (17).
</font>
</p>
<p >
<font  face="Comic" ms="#DEFAULT" sans="#DEFAULT">
It is further assumed that the distribution among classes of the ~5 billion hectares of degraded land is proportional to that of degraded land in the global soil survey (summarized above), for which the data appear most reliable (Table 1, column 3) (53). On the basis of the foregoing evaluation of natural and human-accelerated recovery rates, rough rehabilitation times are proposed for each class of land (Table 1, column 2) (54). These estimates are optimistic in that all assume the higher rate of recovery from ranges of possibilities and that rehabilitation will not be hindered by soil loss, lack of colonists, climate change, further human impact, or other important factors.
</font>
</p>
<p >
<font  face="Comic" ms="#DEFAULT" sans="#DEFAULT">
Three scenarios of future changes in global PDIV are considered (Table 1) (55). In scenario A, degradation is arrested immediately. In 25 years, complete recovery occurs on 100% of land in the light class and on 50% of land in the moderate class; the other 50% in the moderate class moves into the light category; 0% of the land in the severe and extreme classes recover sufficiently to move up into another class. Scenario B assumes conservative rates of growth of each degradation class (derived in Table 2). Scenario C assumes rates of degradation double those used in B; these accelerated rates approximate what could occur if vigorous measures to prevent and reverse land degradation are not taken.
</font>
</p>
<p >
<font  face="Comic" ms="#DEFAULT" sans="#DEFAULT">
The analysis suggests that ~ 10% of global PDIV of land has already been lost (Table 3). From a biophysical perspective, recovery of half of this loss may be feasible in 25 years, provided that degradation is halted and strong rehabilitation measures are initiated immediately. In the absence of such measures, a very conservative extrapolation of present rates of degradation suggests that ~16% of global PDIV could be lost in 25 years. At more realistic, accelerated rates of degradation, this loss could reach ~20%. In the latter scenario (C), the land area irreversibly degraded from a socioeconomic perspective (in the severe and extreme classes) would increase by a factor of 1.8 over 1995 levels. These results are most useful for relative, rather than absolute, comparisons.

Costs and Benefits of Rehabilitation
</font>
</h3>
<p >
<font  face="Comic" ms="#DEFAULT" sans="#DEFAULT">
Although a general lack of information on rehabilitation costs constitutes a serious shortcoming (56), the utter dependence of human well-being on productive land makes its continued degradation for short term gain an unwise course. Moreover, the costs of off-site degradation may be substantial (57).
</font>
</p>
<p >
<font  face="Comic" ms="#DEFAULT" sans="#DEFAULT">
UNEP estimates the direct, on-site cost of failure to prevent desertification during the period 1978 to 1991 at between $300 billion and $600 billion (in U.S. dollars) (58). Currently, the total direct, on-site income foregone as a result of desertification is ~$42.3 billion year- 1 By contrast, UNEP's estimates of the direct annual cost of all preventive and rehabilitational measures range between $10.0 billion and $22.4 billion.
</font>
</p>
<p >
<font  face="Comic" ms="#DEFAULT" sans="#DEFAULT">
An enormous potential for recovery is inherent in most land types, but failure to realize this potential can result in rapid, essentially irreversible deterioration. Historically, land degradation has been implicated in the fall of great civilizations (59) and merits serious attention by this one (60).

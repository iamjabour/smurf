Description
</strong>
SCORE provides a comprehensive, holistic approach, training schools to institute a program incorporating appropriate placement, study skills, academic support, multiple modality teaching techniques, counseling, and mentoring. SCORE trainers work with schools to design a customized program for accelerating the achievement of high-risk youth, train staff, and provide follow-through support with a set of materials, workbooks, videotapes, and consultation. Students are heterogeneously grouped in a college core curriculum leading to university eligibility upon graduation. The program has five major components: (1) Tutoring and Study Skills; (2) Guidance; (3) Parents; (4) Motivational Activities; and (5) Summer Acceleration. Local trainers can be developed to inservice new staff and serve as program consultants. SCORE addresses National Educational Goals 3 and 8.

Evidence of Effectiveness
</strong>
Five claims of effectiveness were evaluated using case studies, pre/post test gains, and reversal of downward trends in college eligibility and college attendance. Each program component was evaluated for both individual and combined effectiveness. Results showed that high-risk students who participate in SCORE are successfully enrolled into a common core college preparatory curriculum; SCORE high-risk students enroll in colleges and universities at higher rates than their peers; students involved in SCORE test out of LEP programs at rates higher than their peers; SCORE schools decrease remedial course offerings and increase college preparatory curriculum; and schools that implement an effective SCORE program increase graduation rates.

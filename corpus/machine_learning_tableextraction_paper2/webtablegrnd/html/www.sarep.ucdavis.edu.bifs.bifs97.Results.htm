AB3383 states that the biennial report from the University should include, in addition to the analysis of the monitoring activities and summary of pesticide and fertilizer use described above, an analysis of the success of each project in meeting the standards for integrated farming systems. (Section 597) The UC SAREP BIFS request for proposals defines integrated farming systems as systems where farmers integrate the following elements into their production systems:
</p>

<dl >
<dt >
<font  size="2">
(1) Biological and cultural control of pests;

<dt >
<font  size="2">
(2) On-farm habitats for beneficial insects, mites, and spiders;
</font>
</dt>
<dt >
<font  size="2">
(3) A strong emphasis on soil-building practices, often including biological nitrogen fixation to supply all or part of the nitrogen needed by crop plants;

(4)Reduced reliance on agricultural chemicals.

This section presents an analysis of the success of each BIFS project in meeting the above-stated standards and the conclusions of the first annual review by the director and program advisory review board.

WINEGRAPE BIFS PROJECT
</b>
</p>
<p >
Growers with vineyards enrolled in the Winegrape BIFS project implemented a range of integrated farming systems practices during the 1996 season. These include the following practices: 91 percent of vineyards had cover crops; leaves were pulled in 51 percent of vineyards (leaf pulling lowers leafhopper numbers, improves spray coverage, reduces incidence of bunch rot by increasing air circulation around bunches); compost was applied to 30 percent of vineyards; no insecticides or miticides were used in 46 percent of the vineyards; predacious mites were released in two of the six vineyards where mite were at problem levels; 29 percent of the vineyards did not use pre-emergent herbicides for under-the-vine weed management (it was handled by mechanical means in 10 percent of the vineyards while 19 percent used contact herbicides only); 100 percent of the vineyards were monitored weekly during the growing season; and 57 percent of the vineyards have converted to drip irrigation (see

Growers enrolled in the Winegrape BIFS project have been able to integrate a wide range of practices and/or procedures important in integrated farming systems. However, without pre-BIFS data it is difficult to assess the impact of the Winegrape BIFS project on the adoption of integrated farming practices. These data are in the process of being collected and the project supervisor will report the finding to UC SAREP and the program advisory review board by June 30, 1997. In addition, the Winegrape BIFS project coordinator is working on a mail-out survey instrument that will be sent to the entire 650 Lodi-Woodbridge Winegrape Commission growers in January 1997. This survey will address grower attitudes, perceptions, and behaviors of integrated farming systems. The combination of pre-BIFS data and the survey results will provide a comprehensive information pool to assess the success of the Winegrape BIFS project.
</p>
<p >
The following list summarizes conclusions from the November 19, 1996 annual review meeting and subsequent analysis by UC SAREP of the Winegrape BIFS project:
</p>
<ul >
<li >
The in-season pest monitoring program is a strong point in this project. All fields enrolled in project were monitored weekly during the season for key biological indicators important for pest management. Monitoring for soil biological indicators can be improved.
</li>
</ul>
<ul >
<li >
The development of a data management system (the relational database) and the scope of information monitoring entered into this database is an outstanding accomplishment. This system should be adapted to other BIFS and BIFS-style projects.
</li>
</ul>
<ul >
<li >
Baseline data on the previous year?s crop yields, fertilizer and pesticide use were not reported. The project supervisor has been directed to collect and analyze these data and to submit them to UC SAREP by June 30, 1997.
</li>
</ul>
<ul >
<li >
Harvest data on crop yield and quality were difficult to collect prior to the annual report due date. The project supervisor will collect, analyze and report these data by June 30, 1997.
</li>
</ul>

WEST SIDE BIFS PROJECT
</b>
</p>
<p >
The principal success in implementing integrated farming practices in the West Side BIFS project is in the area of soil-building. All 16 plots enrolled in the West Side BIFS project applied either compost (12 plots) or grew a cover crop (4). For many of the plots, this was the first time that organic material was added other than from crop residue. One of the adjunct projects, an on-farm demonstration of low-rate Treflan applications, also showed significant promise in reducing the rate of this herbicide by 30 to 60 percent. Treflan is currently applied to 95 percent of tomato acreage; large-scale adoption of this practice could lead to significant reductions in Treflan use. A number of the adjunct projects will involve demonstrating various biologically based practices in the 1997 season. In the 1997 season, soil building will remain the main strength of the West Side BIFS project. However, additional attention needs to be go into providing growers with pest management monitoring and technical support in biological and cultural controls of key pests. The project leader has been directed to provide a plan for this monitoring and technical support by March 31, 1997.
</p>
<p >
The following list summarizes conclusions from the November 19, 1996 annual review meeting and subsequent analysis by UC SAREP of the West Side BIFS project:
</p>
<ul >
<li >
The soil quality monitoring program was excellent. This program involved collecting baseline and end-of-season data on key soil physical and chemical properties.
</li>
</ul>
<ul >
<li >
The pest management monitoring program did a very poor job of monitoring pests and natural enemies. Only four of the 16 sites were intensively monitored. This component of the project must be improved in subsequent years. Renewed funding of this project is contingent on development and submission of a monitoring program by March 31, 1997.
</li>
</ul>
<ul >
<li >
Baseline and end-of-season data on the previous year?s fertilizer and pesticide use were not presented at the annual review meeting or in the annual report. The project supervisor has been directed to collect and analyze these data and to submit them to UC SAREP by June 30, 1997.
</li>
</ul>
<ul >
<li >
Good data were collected on tomato yield and quality for the 1996 season.

Analysis of 1996 ACU Ratings of Congress

A NOTE ON VOTE SELECTION:
</strong>
<br ></br>
<br ></br>
</p>
<p >
<strong >
Four categories of votes.
</strong>
As the umbrella lobbying group of the conservative movement, ACU tracks a wide range of issues before the Congress, ranging from taxes to abortion, from ballistic missile defenses to term limits. Accordingly, the votes we choose to rate are broken down into four general categories: economic and budget matters; social and cultural issues; defense and foreign policy matters; and issues of institutional reform. We endeavor to analyze a roughly equal number of votes from each category, so that we can obtain a comprehensive picture of an individual Member's ideological predisposition, based on votes cast.
<br ></br>
<br ></br>
</p>
<p >
<strong >
Votes rated on ideological distinction, NOT "most important."
</strong>
Within those four broad areas, ACU selects the votes it rates based on a simple criterion: does the vote reflect a clear ideological distinction in the Congress? Thus, the votes we select to rate are not necessarily those considered the "most important" or the "key" votes of any given congressional session. And they may not be votes we took a position or lobbied on during floor consideration. They are chosen for one reason, and one reason only: to provide a clear picture of where individual Members of Congress stand on an ideological scale.
<br ></br>
<br ></br>
</p>
<p >
Thus, for example, the 1993 vote on NAFTA was not rated, though it clearly was one of the most important votes of the session, in terms of legislative impact. The NAFTA vote was omitted from the 1993 ratings because it was not an ideologically-driven vote: many conservatives voted yes, while a significant number of conservatives voted no. Similarly, many liberals voted no, but a significant number voted yes.
<br ></br>
<br ></br>
</p>
<p >
In our 1996 ratings, we did not include the Defense of Marriage Act, which will define marriage as the union between one man and one woman -- clearly, an important piece of conservative legislation, and one on which we lobbied -- because it did not offer a clear ideological distinction. When a measure garners 342 votes in the House and 85 votes in the Senate, it's hard to argue that there's an ideological motivator at work.
<br ></br>
<br ></br>
</p>
<p >
Moreover, we can only rate floor votes -- not committee or subcommittee votes, and not proposed legislation that never received a floor vote. Thus, we could not rate President Clinton's health care plan in 1994, because it never made it to the floor. Nor could we rate this year's Defend America Act, calling for near-term deployment of ballistic missile defenses, because it was pulled from consideration before going to the floor of either house for a vote.
<br ></br>
<br ></br>
</p>
<p >
These simple but important criteria are helpful in understanding any perceived differences between a Member's ACU rating and his or her rating from other organizations which provide ratings of Congress, such as the AFL-CIO, the Christian Coalition, or the Chamber of Commerce.

Vote breakdown.
</strong>
For the second session of the 104th Congress, we rated 20 votes in the House, and 20 votes in the Senate. No votes were double-weighted. As a result, each vote -- assuming a member cast a vote on all 20 rated votes -- is worth five points. (We do not count missed votes as either "for" or "against;" thus, the value of each individual vote rises for each vote missed by a member.)

WHAT DO THE DATA SHOW?
</strong>
<br ></br>
<br ></br>
</p>
<p >
<strong >
104th: Conservative Congress
</strong>
. The 104th Congress was the most conservative Congress of the last generation. This declaration is based on two fundamental factors: first, the aggregate vote ratings of the individual members, and, second, an analysis of what legislation was considered and passed.
<br ></br>
<br ></br>
</p>
<p >
<strong >
Conservative Ratings
</strong>
. With Republicans having a majority in both chambers, this is hardly earth-shattering news. In the House, the average score for the second session of the 104th Congress was a slightly right-of-center 55; in the Senate, an even more slightly right-of-center 53.
<br ></br>
<br ></br>
</p>
<p >
That compares favorably with the final year of the last Democrat-controlled Congress, the 103rd, where the average score in the House was a 47, and the average score in the Senate a 41.
<br ></br>
<br ></br>
</p>
<p >
Average Republican scores in both houses in 1996 were significantly higher than average Democratic scores. In the House, the average Republican score was a 90; the average Democratic score, a 15. In the Senate, the average Republican score was an 88 ; the average Democratic score was a 13.
<br ></br>
<br ></br>
</p>
<p >
In addition, there were 101 perfect conservative scores in the House, as opposed to 79 perfect liberal scores. And there were 15 perfect conservative scores in the Senate, as opposed to 9 perfect liberal scores.
<br ></br>
<br ></br>
</p>
<p >
<strong >
Conservative Legislation
</strong>
. More important than just the ratings themselves, however, is a look at what kind of legislation was proposed, considered, and passed in the 104th Congress. And on that score as well, the 104th emerges as the most conservative Congress of the last generation.
<br ></br>
<br ></br>
<br ></br>
<br ></br>
</p>
<p >
For instance, compare the 104th Congress with the last Democrat-controlled Congress, its immediate predecessor, the 103rd:
<br ></br>
<br ></br>
</p>
<ul >
<li >
The liberal 103rd Congress passed the largest tax increase in history; the conservative 104th Congress not only didn't even consider a tax increase bill, it actually passed a major tax cut.
</li>
<li >
The liberal 103rd Congress put in place an unbalanced budget with hundreds of billions of dollars worth of red ink; the conservative 104th Congress passed a balanced budget for the first time in a generation.
</li>
<li >
The liberal 103rd Congress failed to pass the Balanced Budget Amendment through either house; the conservative 104th Congress succeeded in passing the Balanced Budget Amendment through the House, but failed by a single vote in the Senate.
</li>
<li >
The liberal 103rd Congress attempted to pass a comprehensive health care bill that would have essentially nationalized our health care delivery system, and failed; the conservative 104th Congress considered a smaller, more finely-tuned health care reform bill, and succeeded.
</li>
<li >
The liberal 103rd Congress didn't even consider major welfare reform; the conservative 104th Congress succeeding in passing, with bipartisan support, the most sweeping reform of a federal entitlement program in history.
</li>
<li >
The liberal 103rd Congress began a major cut in America's national defense structure; the conservative 104th Congress began to repair the damage and restore much-needed funds.
</li>
<li >
The liberal 103rd Congress didn't even consider a term-limits constitutional amendment; the conservative 104th Congress brought it to a floor vote in the House (where it was defeated by liberal Democrats), and tried to consider it in the Senate (where it was filibustered by Democrats).
</li>
<li >
The liberal 103rd Congress failed to pass any significant institutional reforms; the conservative 104th Congress passed the line-item veto, legislation outlawing unfunded mandates, the Shays Act (applying all federal workplace laws to the Congress itself), and significant lobbying reform.
</li>
<br ></br>
<br ></br>
</ul>
<p >
Thus, it's clear that not only was the 104th Congress the most conservative in a generation in terms of individual scores, but in terms of the legislation considered and passed. The terms of the debate have shifted: no longer are we arguing about raising taxes, but about whose taxes will be cut; no longer are we arguing about balancing the budget, but about how it will be balanced; no longer are we arguing about the need for welfare reform, but about how it will be reformed.
<br ></br>
<br ></br>
</p>
<p >
<strong >
The 1996 elections and the 105th Congress
</strong>
. The 1996 elections are crucial: they will determine whether the 105th Congress continues making common-sense conservative reforms, or whether we revert to a liberal Democratic agenda.
<br ></br>
<br ></br>
</p>
<p >
Even a cursory analysis of the individual vote ratings of the members who would be committee chairmen in the 105th Congress reveals the stark differences between the two parties.
<br ></br>
<br ></br>
</p>
<p >
In the House, should the Republicans maintain control, the average score of the presumed committee chairmen would be an 84. Should the Democrats recapture the House, the average score of the presumed committee chairmen would be a 9.
<br ></br>
<br ></br>
</p>
<p >
In the Senate, should the Republicans maintain control, the average score of the presumed committee chairmen would be a 74. Should the Democrats recapture the Senate, the average score of the presumed committee chairmen would be a 15.
<br ></br>
<br ></br>
</p>
<p >
The accompanying charts show these figures in clear detail.

A problem that arises often in physics and engineering is to find the temperature at any point on a two-dimensional object which is held at a constant temperature at each edge. The following figure illustrates this problem.
<p ></p>

</center>
<p >
In the problem we are assuming the object to be a plate with length (L) and width (W). Also, we are assuming we know the temperatures (T1,T2,T3 and T4) of the edges. The goal is to be able to find the temperature of any point (x,y) within the plate.
</p>
<p >
This problem can be solved in many different ways. However, most ways to solve this problem are taught in upper level college math or engineering courses such as differential equations or a finite element class.
</p>
<p >
There is one method that can give us an excellent approximation and incorporates a basic statistical idea. This idea is that of random walks or more generally,

.
</p>
<p >
First consider this problem. Let the following picture be a street map.
</p>
<p ></p>

A person decides to take a walk, starting at point (6,3). This person decides to walk each block randomly therefore he can walk either north, south, east or west. To decide, he tosses
<b >
two coins
</b>
and uses this rule to tell him which way to walk.
<p >
<!-- List Tag -->
</p>
<ul >
<li >
HH -&gt; (one block north)
</li>
<li >
HT -&gt; (one block east)
</li>
<li >
TH -&gt; (one block west)
</li>
<li >
TT -&gt; (one block south)
</li>
</ul>
Toss your two coins, four times.
<p >
<!-- List Tag -->
</p>
<ul >
<li >
Where does this person end up?
</li>
<li >
At what edge(s) is the person most likely to arrive at?
</li>
<li >
What edge(s) is the person least likely to arrive at?
</li>
</ul>
<p >
We can do a similar method of finding the temperature of the point problem mentioned earlier. Consider this situation.
</p>
<p ></p>
<center >
<!-- Graphic Tag -->

</center>
<p >
We want to find the temperature at the point (6, 3).
</p>
<p >
This problem can be solved by taking a two dimensional random walk. We will do a random walk starting at the point of interest until one of the edges is reached and consider that to be one trial. Then the walk is repeated at the same initial point. After sufficient trials have been completed, the average of all the temperatures obtained is taken to be an estimate of the temperature at that point.

For example, a computer performed the above problem for 50 trials. The results were

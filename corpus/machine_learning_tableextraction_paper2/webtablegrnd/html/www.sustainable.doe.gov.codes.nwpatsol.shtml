<p >
14-102
<b >
Subdivision Provisions; Land Suitability:
</b>
No land shall be subdivided within the City of Pattonsburg if the parcel or parcels of land proposed for development are deemed unsuitable for a proposed use because of flooding potential, inadequate water supply or sewage disposal facilities, known mining subsidence areas from past mining activities, or any other conditions likely to be harmful to the health, safety or welfare of future residents of the proposed subdivision or of the community.
</p>
<p >
14-103
<b >
Mineral Exploration and Commercial Mining:
</b>
Within the corporate limit of the City of Pattonsburg, regardless of zone district, all commercial-scale mineral exploration and mining activities shall be subject to the granting of a conditional use permit prior to the commencing of such work. The permit shall specify the nature of the proposed work, its duration, and the safeguards to be employed in protecting the general public from any excavations left as a result of mineral exploration or commercial mining.
</p>
<p >
14-104
<b >
Solar Access Provision:
</b>
The use of solar energy collectors for the purpose of providing energy for heating and/or cooling is a permitted use within all zone districts, whether as a part of a structure or incidental to a group of structures in the nearby vicinity. Use of solar energy collectors is subject to the restraints imposed by the present development pattern and topography found inside the city limits of Pattonsburg plus the zoning, height, and where a strict provision of the zoning ordinance may prohibit adequate solar access, the developer may apply for a conditional use permit from the city by filing said application with the planning commission. The Planning Commission shall weigh the following factors in its evaluation:
</p>
<blockquote >
<b >
(A)
</b>
Different levels of solar access available and restrictiveness of ordinance with regard to height, bulk, setback, and related provisions.
<p >
<b >
(B)
</b>
Local energy costs, topography, and aesthetics of the specific area or land tract proposed for solar access use.
</p>
<p >
<b >
(C)
</b>
Characteristics of shading due to building and trees in determination of necessary solar access plane.
</p>
<p >
<b >
(D)
</b>
Identification of possible conflicts with solar access, including architectural or historic preservation requirements, steep slopes, low and moderate income housing restrictions, and individual landowner preferences.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p >
14-105
<b >
Solar Access Requirements:
</b>
When a solar energy collection system is installed on a lot, accessory structures or vegetation on an abutting lot shall not be located so as to block the solar collectors access to solar energy. The portion of a solar collector that is protected is the portion which:
</p>
<blockquote >
<b >
(A)
</b>
Is located so as not to be shaded between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. by a hypothetical 12-foot obstruction located on the lot line; and,
<p >
<b >
(B)
</b>
Has an area not greater than one-half of the heated floor area of the structure, or the largest of the structures, to be served.

</blockquote>
<p >
14-106
<b >
Solar Access Exemptions:
</b>
Section 10-104 (above) does not apply to structures or vegetation existing in an abutting lot at the time of installation of the solar energy collection system, or the effective date of this ordinance, whichever is later. Said subjection controls any structure erected on, or vegetation planted in, abutting lots after the installation of the solar energy collection system.
</p>
<p >
14-107
<b >
Solar Energy System Installed; Recording Procedures:
</b>
A statement that a solar energy collection system is installed in a lot shall be filed and recorded with the Zoning Administrator or City Clerk, and that the date of installation of said system shall be the date of recordation.
</p>
<p >
14-108
<b >
Unconventional and Earth Sheltered Housing Encouraged:
</b>
It is recognized that innovative housing designs appear from time to time that encourage energy conservation, create welcome diversity in the community, and which will appeal to home builders and buyers. It is the intent of this ordinance, through the provisions of the Special Use Permit and variance procedures contained herein, to recognize and encourage creative, efficient, and well-designed housing of innovative varieties. Each sheltered housing as one example of newer trends in housing construction, shall generally adhere to the following provisions, based on the issuance by the Board of Aldermen of a Conditional Use Permit and granting of any applicable variances from the strict design provisions of the ordinance.
</p>
<blockquote >
<b >
(A)
</b>
Densities or lot areas and lot widths for earth sheltered housing units shall conform to those established residential zone districts R-1 and R-2.
<p >

III. Site Planning Requirements for All Buildings
</h3>
<blockquote >
<b >
A.
</b>
All buildings (other than zero lot line) and landscaping must be designed and located so as not to interfere with the reasonable use of adjoining properties for solar applications. Evergreens should not be planted closer than twenty feet (20') from side lot lines adjoining a building lot.
<p >
<b >
B.
</b>
All residential lots must have trees planted to maximize summer cooling.
</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 >
IV. Recommended Procedures
</h3>
<blockquote >
<b >
A.
</b>
Citizens should use energy efficient equipment wherever reasonably practical, including energy efficient motors, processes, lighting, and daylighting, passive solar, solar water heaters, geothermal, biomass, load management, photovoltaics, district heating and cogeneration.
<p >
<b >
B.
</b>
Citizens should use and participate in state and federal energy programs including Green Lights, Nice

</sup>
KP, Exemplary Buildings, Motor Challenge, PT1 Green Buildings, Rebuild America, SECP, Energy Star Buildings, SBA Pollution Control Loans, SBA EERE Loans and ISTEA Enhancement Funds as well as such other similar programs as may exist from time to time.
</p>
<p >
<b >
C.
</b>
Citizens should orient both new construction and relocated buildings to maximize the solar benefits that they or future generations may obtain.
</p>
<p >
<b >
D.
</b>
In relocating existing residences to and placing manufactured homes in New Pattonsburg, citizens should: (i) have an energy audit and analysis conducted to identify practical energy conservation measures, (ii) replace heating and cooling equipment and appliances with energy efficient devices, (iii) construct on foundations designed to increase energy efficiency and (iv) weatherize the dwellings.
</p>
<p >
<b >
E.
</b>
In constructing new homes in New Pattonsburg, citizens should (i) make maximum use of daylighting, (ii) use roof colors that decrease cooling needs, (iii) landscape to maximize solar and wind benefits and (iv) use energy efficient lighting throughout the house.
</p>
<p >
<b >
F.
</b>
Citizens should use vines and trellises to shade outdoor cooling units and the southern exposure of buildings.

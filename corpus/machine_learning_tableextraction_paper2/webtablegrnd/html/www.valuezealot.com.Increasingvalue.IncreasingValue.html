There are only five ways to increase the value of a company. There are countless specific strategies, investment options, and decisions facing management, but they all fall into one or more of these categories. These actions can be applied at the corporate level or at each individual SBU. I recommend that each unit's
<a  href="../Strategciplan/Strategic%20Planning.html">

</a>
contain a section that addresses these five methods of increasing value. Please see

This is the foundation of value creation. Unfortunately, this simple self evident premise is often overlooked. When you invest cash in a new investment you are using value that was created in prior investments or given to you by investors. The risk of new investments should not be taken lightly and should be the major focus of new investment ideas. Remember, most corporations only earn about 5% on sales. This means that for every dollar you waste you must generate $20 of new sales just to get back to even. If your new idea ends up wasting $10 million an additional $200 million in Sales is required just to get your shareholders back to where they were. You should first worry about the return

This sounds simple and it is--financially speaking. The challenge is coming up with the project idea in the first place and then executing it. There is no mystery in whether a given investment idea, with a particular set of assumptions, will increase value or destroy it. That is the purpose of
<a  href="../Investmentanalysis/Investment%20Analysis.html">
proper investment analysis
</a>
--ensuring that the decision makers understand all of the relevant assumptions that are in a particular investment scenario. Making new investments with NPV &gt; $0 (IRR &gt; A-tax Cost of Capital) increases the value of the corporation assuming that the risk profile and maximum cash outlay are acceptable. The hard part is executing the project so that the actual cash flows are as predicted or better.

This method can be a lot of fun and very rewarding. You already have a business unit up and running so you can now turn your focus on improving its operations to keep it generating value for your shareholders, satisfying your customers, and frustrating competitors. You can increase the value of a business unit by increasing cash profits or by reducing net assets (i.e., the shareholder's investment). Profits are increased by increasing sales and/or lowering costs. Net assets can be reduced by shedding plant and equipment and/or improving the cash conversion cycle (lowering net working capital).

This is probably the most hated and overlooked way of increasing value. Any suggestion of disposing of assets or whole business units is usually met with severe hostility because it implies that a bad investment decision was made previously. This is often the case but also conditions may have changed causing a once profitable investment to turn bad. Proper investment analysis is unemotional and will warn management that they have assets or whole business units that are destroying value instead of increasing it. This may not be pleasant, but it is essential to admit mistakes and correct them before they consume shareholder's wealth. Each business unit or project contributes--for better or worse--to the company's ROA and therefore, each should be monitored continuously and actively managed.

Lowering the corporation's cost of capital increases value by not only lowering the actual financing expenses, but more importantly, by increasing the value of all of its future cash flows. This is usually considered the responsibility of the treasurer, but all of the SBU's can play a role in decreasing the corporation's cost of capital. Obviously, the treasury department should find the lowest cost financing that keeps the corporation solvent. The SBU's can also do their part in lowering the cost of capital by consistently delivering growing earnings without unduly adding to the investment base. This gives the corporation credibility in the markets and lowers the investor's required risk premium.

Lowering our country's tax rates would increase the value of all companies, large and small, and increase the wealth of all citizens--immediately and dramatically. This simple concept appears to be impossible to implement in our increasingly socialistic country. Also, I am shocked at how many CEO's and others in top management vote to harm their corporations given this known link between taxes and value destruction. Take any NPV/IRR analysis that you have done and watch what happens to NPV when you lower the tax rate to 5% vs. the current 38%.

This staggering increase in value is real

and given it is readily demonstrable it proves that anyone who defends our current tax system and its high rates is either ignorant or evil. See

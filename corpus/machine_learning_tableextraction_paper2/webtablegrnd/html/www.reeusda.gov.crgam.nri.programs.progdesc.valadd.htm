Research in the area of value-added products is needed to enhance the competitive value of U.S. agricultural products. Specifically, there is an opportunity to obtain greater economic value from agricultural materials through conversion to high-value products for both domestic and export markets, with the benefits of increased income, job creation, and rural development. This opportunity can be realized through development of new products (from conventional and new plant and animal sources), making existing products more valuable, increasing process efficiencies, making greater use of co-products and waste materials, and through greater integration of agricultural and forest components.
</p>
<p >
The aim of fundamental and mission-linked research supported by this program is to build the scientific base of knowledge to use agricultural and forest materials more fully and effectively in food and non-food products. Research is encouraged in two general areas: (a) to increase understanding of the physical, chemical, and biological properties of raw agricultural materials and products that are important for quantifying, predicting, protecting, and controlling their quality, value, and processing characteristics and (b) to develop innovative products and processes for better utilization and more efficient conversion of agricultural materials and co-products to value-added food and non-food products.
</p>
<p >
Research should emphasize processes and products that are environmentally acceptable, energy-efficient, and economically feasible. Proposals should identify potential applications of the research or address identified market opportunities. Product development efforts should seek to understand and overcome underlying scientific and technical issues as well as normal product development issues such as economic feasibility and market potential. Research on integrated production and processing for generation of high-value products, in particular those that emphasize local processing, is encouraged. Research will be supported in two programmatic subcategories: food characterization/process/product research and non-food characterization/process/product research.

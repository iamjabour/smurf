                          Jan. 10, 2003

The package includes the web table groundtruth database used in table
detection recognition research.  The details of the database can be 
found at our two papers as below.

You are welcome to use and distribute the database under the terms of the
licence for research or commercial purposes,
however please acknowledge its use with a citation:

In this package, there are two subdirectories,

html ---- It includes 1,393 HTML pages collected from around 200 web sites.
There are a total of 14,609 <TABLE> nodes, including 11,477 leaf <TABLE>
nodes.  Out of the 11,477 leaf <TABLE> nodes, 1,740 are genuine tables
and 9,737 are non-genuine tables.  We use a home brewed HTML DTD to write the
ground truth information in the HTML files.  The HTML DTD file is in DTD 
directory.

DTD ---- It includes our home brewed HTML DTD.  The major difference
between it and a standard HTML 3.2 is that we added some new attribute-value
pairs in the table attribute list.  With the parser which we got from 
javax.swing.text.html.parser, this DTD can be used to parse the table
groundtruth html files.

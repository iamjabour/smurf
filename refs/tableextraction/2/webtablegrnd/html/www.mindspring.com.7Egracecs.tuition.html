If an account is in arrears $50 or more as of the 8th of the month following billing that 30 days earlier, a late fee of $10 will be assessed at the end of business that day or the first business day following the 8th. Late fees will be applied each month that the account balance is in arrears $50 or more.

<br ></br>
The school will communicate with the responsible party sixty days after statement date if the account balance continues to exceed $50.

An account that still exceeds $50 in arrears ninety days after statement date is cause for disenrollment, unless a payment contract has already been put into place. If the responsible party has a balance due on July 1st, the family will not be permitted to re-enroll in the fall. No student records or transcripts will be sent on behalf of students until the account is satisfied.
<br ></br>

Statements are mailed on the 10th of each month or the first business day following if the the 10th falls on a weekend or holiday. Payments are always due in full on the 1st of each month.

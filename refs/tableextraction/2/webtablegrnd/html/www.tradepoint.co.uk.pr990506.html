Refinancing Arrangements

</p>

Highlights
</b>
</p>
<p >
Tradepoint, the UK order-driven stock exchange, has previously indicated its need for additional finance and today announces a long-term financing package that greatly enhances its future prospects.
</p>
<ul >
<li >
The refinancing takes the form of a subscription for 70 million new Ordinary Shares at 20p per share by a consortium led by Instinet, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Reuters Group PLC. This represents 54.4% of the enlarged equity. The Consortium consists of Instinet, American Century, Archipelago (25% owned by Goldman Sachs and 25% owned by E*Trade), JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley.
<br ></br>
</li>
<li >
The Consortium will be granted two series of new warrants to subscribe for 13,228,476 shares at 45p and 16,262,406 shares at 60p which would take its ownership to approximately 62.9%. Instinet itself has been granted warrants to subscribe for a further 6 million shares at 45p. Exercise of those warrants would take the combined ownership to approximately 64.3%.
<br ></br>
</li>
<li >
The agreement governing the existing Loan Stock contains significant redemption and conversion rights as well as restrictions on actions by the Company. As a condition of the Subscription, the Loan Stock is to be converted to remove the effect of these restrictions. In order to gain the agreement of the Loan Stockholders to convert, it is proposed that their conversion price is reduced from 40p to 28.363636p per share.
<br ></br>
</li>
<li >
Instinet has agreed to provide interim financing pending the completion of the Subscription.
<br ></br>
</li>
<li >
The Board believes the combination of the finance and the nature of the Consortium members represents a major opportunity to further develop the Company's business, as a low-cost, efficient, for-profit exchange.
<br ></br>
</li>
<li >
Significant potential for co-operation between Tradepoint and the Consortium members should improve liquidity and Tradepoint's future prospects for profitability. These include a planned electronic link between Instinet and Tradepoint and the opportunity to broaden the range of securities traded on the Tradepoint Stock Exchange.
<br ></br>
</li>
<li >
The global presence and market strength of the members of the Consortium and their focus on reducing transaction costs should greatly assist Tradepoint's participation in the evolution of a global exchange model.
<br ></br>
</li>
<li >
On completion of the Subscription the Consortium will have the right to appoint a majority of the Board of Directors. Peter Stevens will continue as Chairman. Nic Stuchfield, the current Chief Executive, will, after a suitable handover period, resign and be succeeded by Richard Kilsby of Instinet.
<br ></br>
</li>
<li >
The transaction is conditional upon the Takeover Panel waiving the requirement for a general offer to shareholders, conversion of the Loan Stock, shareholders' approval and regulatory consents.
<br ></br>
</li>
<li >
Trading in the Ordinary Shares, which is currently suspended, will recommence on AIM with effect from 9.00am tomorrow, 7 May 1999 and on the Vancouver Stock Exchange from 6.30am (local time) tomorrow.
<br ></br>
</li>
</ul>
<p >
Commenting on the announcement, Peter Stevens, Chairman of Tradepoint, said: "Today's announcement provides a springboard for the future development of Tradepoint as the evident opportunities for co-operation between Tradepoint and the members of the Consortium will help us to grow our innovative exchange structure rapidly. This is also a great endorsement of the Tradepoint exchange concept, its progress to date and future potential. With the strength of Instinet and the Consortium, Tradepoint can continue to pursue its goal of evolving into a truly global exchange. We look forward to the future with great confidence and excitement."

</p>
<p >
<b >
1. Background
</b>
</p>
<p >
As outlined in the Chairman's statement accompanying the unaudited quarterly results for the period ended 31 December 1998, Tradepoint Financial Networks plc requires additional finance to ensure its long term viability. Although membership of the Tradepoint Stock Exchange and transaction volumes have grown considerably in the last 12 months, the Company continues to be loss making. At current levels of expenditure the Company's cash resources would, without a further cash injection, rapidly fall below the regulatory minimum required for the Company as a Recognised Investment Exchange.
</p>
<p >
<b >
2. The principal terms of the proposed Investment
</b>
</p>
<p >
In the light of the urgent requirement for new funding, Tradepoint has entered into an agreement with Instinet for:
</p>
<ul >
<li >
subscription of 70,000,000 New Shares at 20p per share;
<br ></br>
</li>
<li >
A Warrants to subscribe up to 13,228,476 Ordinary Shares at 45 pence per share at any time within 24 months of the date of Completion;
<br ></br>
</li>
<li >
B Warrants to subscribe up to 16,262,406 Ordinary Shares at 60 pence per share at any time within 36 months of the date of Completion;
<br ></br>
</li>
<li >
an option to subscribe such number of additional Ordinary Shares as is equal to the number of shares issued pursuant to the exercise of Existing Options granted by the Company, the exercise price being the same price as the exercise price of the corresponding rights; and
<br ></br>
</li>
<li >
C Warrants to subscribe up to 6,000,000 Ordinary Shares at 45 pence per share at any time within 24 months of the date of Completion.
<br ></br>
</li>
</ul>
<p >
The subscription for New Shares will raise approximately £13,100,000 net of expenses and will enable Tradepoint to develop its business.
</p>
<p >
The completion of the Investment is conditional, inter alia, on agreement of the Loan Stockholders to the conversion of all Loan Stock, the Takeover Panel granting a waiver of the requirement to make a general offer for the Company and the existing shareholders of Tradepoint approving the terms of the Investment in general meeting.
</p>
<p >
Instinet has undertaken to procure, insofar as it is able, that no action is taken or omitted to be taken by the Company which would result in the Ordinary Shares ceasing to be listed and traded on AIM or another equivalent exchange without a resolution being passed by the Company in general meeting (excluding in most circumstances Instinet and/or the Consortium). This provision shall not apply if the Company seeks to delist from the Vancouver Stock Exchange.
</p>
<p >
<b >
3. The Consortium
</b>
</p>
<p >
The members of the Consortium have agreed in principle to enter into an arrangement, whether through a joint venture vehicle or by direct investment, by which they will subscribe the New Shares, New Warrants and Parallel Option. If the parties fail to agree the terms of such arrangements then Instinet will take up the New Shares, New Warrants and Parallel Option itself.
</p>
<p >
The members of the Consortium and their proposed interests are as follows:
<!-- In this table, and the ones further down, I have inserted dummy columns so that
     I can right-align the numbers but have them appear roughly centred under the 
     column titles. I've had to put two dummy columns on the end, as one didn't have
     the desired effect - it seemed as though it was ignored. There may be a better
     way though -->

Further details of the members of the Consortium are set out in Schedule 1.
</p>
<p >
The C Warrants to subscribe up to 6,000,000 shares at 45p will be granted to Instinet.
</p>
<p >
<b >
The Subscription will result in the Subscriber owning 54.44% of the enlarged share capital of the Company prior to the exercise of any warrants or options. Following exercise of the New Warrants, the Subscriber will own 64.30% of the issued share capital of Tradepoint.
</b>
</p>
<p >
A full table of the percentage shareholdings after completion of the Investment is set out in Schedule 2.
</p>
<p >
<b >
4. Principal terms of the amendment to the conversion terms of the Loan Stock
</b>
</p>
<p >
Currently the Loan Stockholders have certain redemption, conversion and other rights which prohibit the Company from taking certain actions or decisions without the prior written approval of the Loan Stockholders.
</p>
<p >
The Investment is conditional upon the agreement by the Loan Stockholders to the conversion of their outstanding Loan Stock to remove the above rights. In order to obtain such agreement the terms of the Loan Stock have been revised, conditional upon shareholder approval, such that the Loan Stock will be converted into Ordinary Shares at the rate of 1 Ordinary Share for every 28.363636p of Loan Stock held, instead of the existing conversion rate of 1 Ordinary Share for every 40p of Loan Stock held. This results in an additional 10,000,000 Ordinary Shares being issued to Loan Stockholders, increasing their entitlement from 24,375,000 to 34,375,000 Ordinary Shares.
</p>
<p >
Of the £9,750,000 of Loan Stock which remains outstanding, £6,000,000 of such Loan Stock is held by funds managed by Apax Partners. Because those funds currently hold more than 5% in value of the Loan Stock in issue, Apax Partners is entitled to appoint a person to the Board and Apax Partners will continue to be so entitled, after completion of the Investment, so long as funds managed by Apax Partners continue to hold more than 5% of the voting rights of the Company.
</p>
<p >
<b >
5. Commercial rationale for the Proposal
</b>
</p>
<p >
As stated above, without a significant cash injection, at current levels of expenditure the Company's cash resources will be reduced to a point where the Tradepoint Stock Exchange would rapidly be unable to trade. In addition, the Board has long held the view that the best interests of the Company's shareholders would be served by the involvement of major strategic investors which would be able to assist the Company in the development of its business and which share the Board's belief that the for-profit stock exchange model with increased investor access is the likely future direction of the evolution of stock exchanges.
</p>
<p >
The Board considered a number of financing options and potential partners and concluded that the cash resources made available by the Investment combined with the potential opportunities for co-operation between Tradepoint and the Consortium members would improve liquidity on the Tradepoint Stock Exchange and its future prospects of profitability. The following potential opportunities have been identified:
</p>
<ul >
<li >
the use of the Tradepoint Stock Exchange by Consortium members could substantially improve the level of Tradepoint's trading volumes;
<br ></br>
</li>
<li >
the global presence of the Consortium members and their focus on reducing transaction costs, together with market and technological efficiencies, should assist Tradepoint's participation in the evolution of a global market exchange model;
<br ></br>
</li>
<li >
a planned electronic link between Instinet and Tradepoint, to allow Instinet customers to route orders to the Tradepoint Stock Exchange; and
<br ></br>
</li>
<li >
working in co-operation, Tradepoint and the Consortium will have opportunities to maximise the use of the Tradepoint technology and regulatory licence by broadening the range of securities traded.
<br ></br>
</li>
</ul>
<p >
<b >
6. Use of proceeds
</b>
</p>
<p >
The Subscription will raise approximately £13,100,000 net of expenses. The proceeds of the Subscription will be used to fund the Company's operating costs, and to provide additional capital to pursue the Company's strategic development.
</p>
<p >
Of the amounts raised, the Company will require approximately £435,000 to meet outstanding liabilities due to creditors who have informally agreed to defer payment until the Company receives additional cash resources from a re-financing. Additionally, loyalty bonuses to approximately 50 employees of the Company upon completion of the refinancing will amount to approximately £295,000 in aggregate.
</p>
<p >
£300,000 will be paid to Instinet Global Services Ltd (an affiliate of Instinet) to repay an existing loan of that amount provided to the Company to enable it to meet its obligations as they fall due whilst maintaining the appropriate regulatory reserve. In addition, Instinet will put adequate arrangements in place to ensure that the Company can continue to trade up to the point of Completion.
</p>
<p >
In satisfaction of fees to Williams de Bröe, the Company's financial adviser, the Company has agreed to amend the current exercise price of 85p attaching to 500,000 of the Brokers Warrants to 45p. The balance of 449,028 Brokers Warrants remain exercisable at 85p.
</p>
<p >
<b >
7. Panel Waiver
</b>
</p>
<p >
Under Rule 9 of the Code, any person who acquires shares which (taken together with any shares already held or acquired by persons acting in concert with it) carry 30 per cent or more of the voting rights of a Company to which the Code applies is required, except with the consent of the Panel, to make a general offer to the shareholders of that company.
</p>
<p >
Completion of the Investment is conditional upon the Panel giving their consent to such requirement being waived and the existing Shareholders approving the Investment by an independent vote taken by way of a poll.
</p>
<p >
<b >
8. Management and Employees
</b>
</p>
<p >
Following Completion, the Consortium will have the right to appoint a majority of the Board. Instinet has advised that Peter Stevens will remain as Chairman and after a suitable handover period Nic Stuchfield, Chief Executive Officer, will stand down from the Board. Richard Kilsby, of Instinet, will join the Board and assume the role of Chief Executive Officer. The terms of Mr Stuchfield's departure are being discussed between the parties. Other than as aforesaid, Instinet has confirmed that the existing employment rights of the management and employees of the Company will be safeguarded.
</p>
<p >
<b >
9. Extraordinary General Meeting
</b>
</p>
<p >
A circular to shareholders,
<i >
inter alia
</i>
, convening the Extraordinary General Meeting, will be posted to shareholders shortly. The circular will contain a recommendation from the Board to vote in favour of the necessary resolutions to approve the transactions described herein.
</p>
<p >
<b >
10. Restoration of Trading in Ordinary Shares
</b>
</p>
<p >
Trading in the Ordinary Shares, which is currently suspended, will recommence on AIM with effect from 9.00am tomorrow, 7 May 1999 and on the Vancouver Stock Exchange from 6.30am (local time) tomorrow.

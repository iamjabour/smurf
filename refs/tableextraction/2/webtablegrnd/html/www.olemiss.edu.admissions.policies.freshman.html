College Preparatory Curriculum
</h2>
<p >
Admission of entering freshmen is based on the completion of the College Preparatory Curriculum (CPC) specified below with either a specific minimum grade-point average (GPA) or both a specific GPA and minimum standard test score. Students must submit a
<strong >
high school transcript
</strong>
reflecting satisfactory completion of the following high school course requirements. (Provisional admission may be granted after six semesters of high school provided the transcript indicates that courses to complete the CPC are underway; final admission will require a complete transcript.)

Regular Admission
</h2>
<p >
Regular admission will be granted to the following:
</p>
<ol >
<li >
All students completing the College Preparatory Curriculum (CPC) with a minimum 3.20 high school GPA on the CPC.
</li>
<li >
All students completing the CPC with a minimum 2.50 high school GPA on the CPC and a minimum score of 16 on the composite ACT (or 760 on the SAT).
</li>
<li >
All students completing the CPC with a class rank in the top 50 percent and a minimum score of 16 on the composite ACT (or 760 on the SAT).
</li>
<li >
All students completing the CPC with a minimum 2.00 high school GPA on the CPC and a minimum composite score of 18 on the ACT (or 860 on the SAT).
</li>
<li >
All students who meet certification requirements for the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).
<em >
This option is available to all freshman applicants.
</em>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 >
<a  name="math"></a>
Minimum Mathematics Score
</h2>
<p >
Students whose ACT mathematics score is 16 or less (or SAT mathematics score is 360 or less) are required to enroll in Math 99 (Intermediate Algebra) during the first semester, or to pass the algebra placement exam administered by the Department of Mathematics. These students are also encouraged to participate in the Academic Support Program (see below) during their freshman year.
</p>
<h2 >
<a  name="deficiencies"></a>
Admission with Deficiencies
</h2>
<p >
Mississippi residents who apply for admission, but do not meet the Regular Admission criteria, may be screened for Admission with Deficiencies. These students will enter the Academic Support Program (counseling and testing) held on campus or at other designated locations prior to the beginning of the summer session. Such counseling will include institutional consideration of student interests, special skills, experiences, and other non-cognitive factors. After counseling, students will take a screening test (Mississippi College Placement Examination - MCPE) to assist the institution in its admission decision. Students successfully passing the MCPE will be admitted as regular students for the fall term and will be encouraged to participate in the Academic Support Program during the first two semesters of enrollment.
</p>
<p >
<a  name="acadsupport"></a>
The
<em >
Academic Support Program
</em>
is designed to assist students admitted with deficiencies, as well as other volunteer students, with their freshman courses. The Academic Support Program staff consists of special tutors in mathematics, science, reading, and writing, as well as career counselors. The goal of this program is to provide individualized support for marginally prepared students in regular academic credit courses.
<a  name="summerdev"></a>
Mississippi residents who do not successfully complete the Academic Screening Program's MCPE may be given Admission with Deficiencies and enrolled in the
<em >
Summer Developmental Program.
</em>
This is an intensive program that concentrates on those high school subject areas (writing, reading, mathematics) that are crucial to success in first-year college courses. Students who successfully exit this summer program will receive Admission with Deficiencies to the fall term with the requirement of participation in the Academic Support Program during their freshman year. Students who fail to exit the Summer Developmental Program are counseled to explore other post-secondary opportunities, including those offered by community colleges.
</p>
<p >
<a  name="devcourses"></a>
Students who are admitted with deficiencies may be required, as part of the Academic Support Program, to enroll in the
<em >
developmental courses
</em>
English 99 and/or Mathematics 99. If required, developmental courses
<em >
must
</em>
be taken during the student's first semester of enrollment. Each course carries three hours of non-degree credit. Standards for completion of developmental courses are set by the University and approved by the Board of Trustees of State Institutions of High Learning.
</p>
<h2 >
<a  name="early"></a>
Early Admission
</h2>
<p >
A superior secondary school student may be offered Early Admission at the end of the third year in high school if the following criteria are met:
</p>
<p >
At least a 3.5 GPA on all CPC courses completed, a minimum composite ACT score of 25 (or SAT 1120), recommendation by the applicant's high school principal or guidance counselor, and a passing score on the Mississippi College Placement Examination (MCPE).
</p>
<h2 >
<a  name="creditinhs"></a>
Earning College Credit in High School
</h2>
<p >
In the summer before the senior year in high school, students may earn University credit by attending enrichment programs such as PACE (Promoting Academic and Creative Excellence) and the Summer Institutes in Art and in Music, if the following criteria are met:
</p>
<p >
Completion of at least 15 college preparatory courses with a minimum 3.2 GPA on those courses, recommendation by the applicant's high school principal or guidance counselor, and successful application to PACE or to the Summer Institute.
</p>
<p >
Summer enrichment programs are administered by the Institute for Continuing Studies.

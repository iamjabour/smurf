Croning ceremonies put the value back in aging
</h2>

Clad in purple, surrounded by memorabilia, Linda Sanda stood in her dining room and talked about turning 50.
<p >
About 40 of her close friends, co-workers and family members came to mark the occasion a year ago. But there were no mocking black balloons or teasing "Over the Hill" banners.
</p>
<p >
This was a croning ceremony, designed to invoke spiritual reflection, dignity and wisdom.
</p>
<p >
An ancient rite of passage to honor older women, croning ceremonies had become nearly extinct. But, they are making a comeback. And they're going mainstream.
</p>
<p >
Sanda and at least two other Des Moines-area women, Maureen Barton-Wicks and Sandra Bury, have held croning ceremonies during the past few years. Though still relatively rare in the Midwest, their growing popularity is easily explained.
</p>
<p >
With the oldest baby boomers turning 50 this year, many women are evaluating what it means to stand on the threshold of old age. For some women, croning ceremonies serve as an ideal way to make a statement about that passage.
</p>
<p >
As Bury puts it: "I see so many people fighting the aging process. I wanted to celebrate that to become old is a gift. I didn't want to be afraid of it."
</p>
<p >
The rising interest in croning ceremonies also reflects a larger movement to reassert the value of older women, says Edna Ward, editor of Celebrating Ourselves, A Crone Ritual Book (Astarte Shell Press, $6).
</p>
<p >
In ancient times, she points out, old women were known as crones. They held power and enjoyed status. "Freed from the intimate details of child care and the rigors of economic work, they were the healers, the mediators, the wise of the communities," Ward says in an interview from her home in Boston.
</p>
<p >
Gradually, that power and recognition were lost. By the Middle Ages, crones were often burned as witches, she points out.
</p>
<p >
In modern times, old women have become nearly invisible, pushed aside and forgotten.
</p>
<p >
"We don't listen to her. We shut her up," Ward says. Only a few groups -- African Americans, Native Americans, Asians -- honor old women in this country, she notes.
</p>
<p >
To recapture the value of becoming a crone, the Feminist Spiritual Community of Portland, Maine, began holding crone rituals in the early 1980s. "Since the patriarchy isn't going to value old women, we celebrate ourselves. It's becoming quite widespread," says Ward, now 67 and a member of the Portland group. She had her croning ceremony in 1990.
</p>
<p >
More recently, the Crones Council formed, drawing women from all over the United States. Last year, about 300 women attended Crones Council III in Scottsdale, Ariz., says Ann Kreilkamp, 53, a member of the council and editor of the Crone Chronicles -- A Journal of Conscious Aging.
</p>
<p >
The council attracted all kinds of women, says Kreilkamp. In response, crone groups formed all over the country.
</p>
<p >
Circulation of her journal also testifies to the growing interest. Started six years ago with 100 copies sent to friends, the Crone Chronicles now has 10,000 subscribers. The quarterly journal, published in Kelly, Wyo., dedicates itself to "re-activating the archetype of the crone within contemporary Western culture."
</p>
<p >
Although some women wince at the word crone, Kreilkamp favors the "bite" and "truth-telling" associated with it. According to the Random House Dictionary, a crone is an "ugly, withered, witchlike old woman" or "an old ewe with broken teeth."
</p>
<p >
"You have to work through that word," says Kreilkamp. "It's part of the initiation to accept there's something beyond what culture tells us is real in ourselves. What we're saying is that with aging, there is more and more value gained. Would you rather tell your troubles to a wise old woman or a 20-year-old?"
</p>
<p >
There is no set time to hold a crone ceremony. Some women wait until after menopause or when they turn 56 -- a significant point in the astrological world. Becoming a crone occurs whenever one wants to embrace cronehood. Holding a ceremony is not even necessary, Kreilkamp says.
</p>
<p >
In all cases, the rite of passage carries individual meaning. For Linda Sanda, the ceremony acknowledged the troubled waters she had crossed in her life. For Sandra Bury, 61, of Urbandale, Iowa, who had her croning at 56, it was a celebration of old age. And for Maureen Barton-Wicks, 53, of Des Moines, it was a way to publicly commit her life to God and acknowledge her wisdom. It was not a political statement about the inequality facing women, she adds.
</p>
<p >
"I wanted to say to the world, 'I'm proud of whom I am, and I claim the crone in me,'" Barton-Wicks says.
</p>
<p >
Preparation was intense. Months of reading, writing, reviewing events in their lives and planning occurred. Bury, a Des Moines public school counselor, says the power of the croning ceremony, for her, was more in writing it than going through it.
</p>
<p >
In reviewing her life, Barton-Wicks sobbed repeatedly, reliving various events. "It was horrendous," she recalls. What's more, it was hard work. She revised her ceremony seven times before she was satisfied.
</p>
<p >
Barton-Wicks had her croning during the regular Sunday service at her church. No meal or celebration followed. "To me, it's a sacred ceremony. It's not a birthday party. That was enough for me," she says.
</p>
<p >
Bury's ceremony, held at the church with a few relatives and friends, took about 15 minutes and didn't cost anything. A former harp teacher, Bury wrote a chant that everyone sang. She had four altars, representing north, south, east and west. She brought objects from home that had been important in her life.
</p>
<p >
Sanda, who directs community education programs for the West Des Moines public schools, wanted a celebration in addition to a meaningful experience. She sent invitations and had a buffet supper in her home.
</p>
<p >
What does a woman gain from a croning ceremony?
</p>
<p >
Two years after Barton-Wicks' ceremony, she is studying to be a minister. "I'm allowing myself to be led by spirit, rather than ego. Any today, I appreciate my fears. They're only trying to protect me," she says. As an added bonus, she says, "I no longer feel life is too short or I am too old."

</p>
<p >
Product revenue for the first quarter of 2000 totaled $106 million. Services revenue was $76 million. Services gross margin came in at 35 percent. Including amortization of acquired intangibles of $20 million, the company reported a diluted loss per share of $0.05 for the first quarter.
</p>
<p >
"I am extremely pleased with our first quarter results," stated Ray Bingham, president and CEO of Cadence. "We are exceeding our stated growth plans for 2000, and are delivering groundbreaking technology and design solutions for our customers. Cadence is clearly building upon the positive momentum we established at the end of last year."
</p>
<h3 >
Continued Electronics Growth Fuels Opportunity
</h3>
<p >
Cadence has a robust portfolio of leading-edge design tools, methodology services, and a world-class design services business. As semiconductor and systems companies continue to show strong momentum, Cadence is uniquely positioned to address customer design challenges and time-to-market pressures with this powerful combination of technology solutions and design expertise.
</p>
<p >
In the first quarter, Cadence introduced SP&amp;R (synthesis/place-and-route), the industry’s first integrated system for high-performance integrated circuit (IC) designs. Cadence is the first company to offer a system that includes both physical synthesis and optimization place-and-route tools. The SP&amp;R system supports design flows from register-transfer-level (RTL) or gates to final tapeout.
</p>
<p >
Cadence design services continued to demonstrate its strength in the growing information age electronics market by announcing a multi-year, multi-million dollar engagement with Nokia to design wireless basestation products.
</p>
<p >
In March, Cadence announced iCadence, the new business to business (B2B) Internet and e-services initiative for electronics design that will help reduce cost and speed time-to-market for customers. As part of this initiative, Cadence unveiled SpinCircuit; a B2B e-commerce portal that has created the only Internet gateway that directly connects engineers’ design desktops to the electronics supply chain. SpinCircuit is an independent company formed by Cadence, Hewlett Packard, and Flextronics. Other key partners involved in Spincircuit include AVNET, Inc., All American Semiconductor, and Innoveda.

STR initiated an investigation on Nov. 30, 1976, and held public hearings on Jan. 25, 1977. During the MTN, the US obtained duty reductions on fresh grapefruit only. GATT Art. XXII:1 consultations were held in October 1980, followed by informal discussions. Formal consultations under GATT Art. XXIII:1 were held April 20, 1982. Conciliation efforts in September 1982 failed. On Nov. 2, 1982, the GATT Council agreed to establish a panel. The panel composition and terms of reference of the panel took some months to resolve. The panel met on Oct. 31 and Nov. 29, 1983, and Feb. 13 and Mar. 12, 1984. The factual portion of the panel report was submitted to the parties on Sept. 27. The full report was submitted on Dec. 14, 1984. The GATT Council considered the panel's findings and recommendations on March 12 and April 30, 1985, but the EC blocked any action. On April 30, the US considered the dispute settlement concluded. On May 10 USTR held a public hearing on the substance of our recommendations to the President (50 FR 15266). USTR transmitted his recommendation on May 30, and on June 20 the President determined that the EC practices deny benefits to the US arising under the GATT, are unreasonable and discriminatory, and constitute a burden on US commerce (50 FR 26143). Effective July 6, the President imposed a 40% ad valorem duty on pasta products not containing egg and a 25% ad valorem duty on pasta products containing egg (50 FR 26143). The EC reacted by raising duties on lemons and walnuts imported from the U.S., effective July 8. On July 19, USTR announced that in return for the US suspension of increased duties on imported pasta, the EC would drop its proposed duty increases, reduce EC pasta export subsidies by 45%, and take steps to increase access to the EC market for US citrus exports by Oct. 31. Because the EC did not increase U.S. access to its citrus market by Oct. 31 as promised, the US imposed the substantially higher duties on pasta imported from the EC on Nov. 1. The EC then counter-retaliated and imposed higher duties on lemons and walnuts imported from the U.S. On August 10, 1986, the US and EC reached an agreement that resolved this case. The US obtained tariff concessions from the EC on citrus products. In addition, the agreement provides for EC tariff concessions on almonds and peanuts, in return for certain US tariff reductions. After negotiating this agreement, both the US and EC terminated their retaliatory duties (51 FR 30146). Subsequently the US increased the EC cheese quota (52 FR 8439) and the EC lowered its tariffs on some products. Authority to reduce US tariffs is included in the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, and was implemented by Presidential Proclamation on December 21, 1988. Finally, the US and EC agreed to negotiate a prompt settlement to the pasta dispute (see Docket No. 301-25).

STR initiated an investigation on Aug. 23, 1977. The US consulted with Japan under GATT Art. XXIII:1 in January 1979, which resulted in an understanding to expand the quota on imported leather. In light of this understanding, the President decided not to take retaliatory action; however, on Aug. 1, 1980 (45 FR 51171), he directed USTR to monitor implementation of the understanding. Since the results of the 1979-82 bilateral leather understanding were unsatisfactory, USTR pursued GATT dispute settlement. The US and Japan consulted under GATT Art. XXIII:1 on Jan. 27-28, March 30 and April 12, 1983. A dispute settlement panel under GATT Art. XXIII:2 was authorized on April 20, 1983. That panel heard the case in the fall and winter of 1983-84. In February 1984, the panel found that Japan's leather quotas violated GATT Art. XI and caused nullification or impairment of US GATT benefits. The GATT Council adopted the panel report on May 16, 1984. The US rejected as inadequate Japan's mid-1985 proposal to replace the quota by a high tariff. On Sept. 7, 1985, the President directed USTR to recommend retaliation unless the leather and leather footwear restrictions were satisfactorily resolved by Dec. 1. (See also Docket No. 301-36.) In December 1985 Japan agreed to provide about $236 million in compensation through reduced (or bound) Japanese tariffs. The US raised tariffs on an estimated $24 million in imports of leather and leather goods from Japan, effective March 31, 1986 (51 FR 9435).

On March 1, 1982, the US referred this matter to the Subsidies Code Committee for conciliation. The US later requested a dispute settlement panel, and on April 7 the Committee authorized its establishment. The panel began its work on July 12. On July 21, the President directed USTR expeditiously to complete dispute settlement (47 FR 31841). The panel met again on Oct. 8 and issued factual findings on Jan. 20, 1983. At the EC's request, an additional panel meeting was held March 29. The panel report (3-1 in favor of the U.S.) was submitted to the Subsidies Code Committee May 19. The Committee considered the report on June 9 and Nov. 18, but deferred decision on adoption of the report. In 1985 and 1986, the US increased duties on pasta imports in retaliation against the EC's discriminatory citrus tariffs 50 FR 26143, 33711; 51 FR 30146). The EC counter-retaliated by raising its duties on lemons and walnuts. See the Citrus case, Docket No. 301-11. Under the agreement reached in that case on Aug. 10, 1986, both parties agreed to terminate their retaliatory duties (51 FR 30146) and to settle the pasta dispute through prompt, good faith negotiations. A tentative agreement was reached on Aug. 5, 1987, under which the EC agreed to reduce its pasta export subsidies by 27.5%, which is intended to eliminate all export subsidies on half the pasta exported to the US. The Agreement was signed Sept. 15, 1987. On Sept. 30, 1987, the President directed the Customs Service to exclude from entry into the US any EC pasta unless accompanied by appropriate documentation determined by USTR to be necessary to enforce the Agreement (52 FR 36897).

An additional panel meeting was held on June 28. A final panel report was issued on July 20. The US requested adoption of the panel report in GATT Council meetings of April 30, May 29, June 5 and July 16, but Council action was deferred because the EC was not yet ready to act on the report. On Sept. 7, 1985, the President directed USTR to recommend retaliation unless this case was resolved by Dec. 1, 1985. In December 1985 the US and the EC reached a settlement under which, in addition to subsidy reductions already implemented on canned pears, the EC agreed to phase out processing subsidies for canned peaches. In October and November 1988 USTR consulted with the EC regarding its failure to fully implement the settlement agreement. Technical talks continued in 1989 regarding EC calculation of its subsidies, and the matter was raised at Ministerial level on February 18, 1989. Since the matter remained unresolved as of May 1989, a new investigation was initiated. See Docket 301-71. This investigation was terminated October 1, 1989 (54 FR 41708).

On Nov. 16, 1984, the President determined that Argentine practices were unreasonable and a restriction on US commerce. He directed USTR again to consult, as requested by Argentina, and to submit proposals for action under Sec. 301 within 30 days. Prior to the 30-day period, Argentina lifted its prohibition for a 90-day period (49 FR 45733). In March 1985, the restrictions were lifted, but were replaced by heavy discriminatory taxes which became the subject of renewed consultations. Following additional consultations on September 1, 1988, Argentina reduced the tax further and improved the transparency of its air courier regulations. However, consultations continued in 1989 regarding the application and level of the tax. On May 25, 1989, the U.S. and Argentina reached an agreement with respect to Argentina's fees and providing for non-discriminatory treatment of foreign air couriers in Argentina.

The US and Japan consulted in August, September, November and December 1985, followed by technical discussions in January and February 1986, and further consultations in March, April, May, June and July. On July 31, 1986, the US and Japan reached agreement ad referendum under which Japan would increase access for US firms to the Japanese semiconductor market, and help prevent dumping of semiconductors in US and third country markets. The President approved this agreement in a determination under Sec. 301 and suspended the investigation (51 FR 27811), and the USTR signed the final agreement Sept. 2, 1986. In March 1987, the Section 301 Committee requested public comment on possible US actions in response to Japan's failure to fulfill its obligations under the semiconductor agreement (52 FR 10275). A hearing was held April 13, 1987. On April 17, the President determined that Japan had not implemented or enforced major provisions of the agreement (52 FR 13419), and in response proclaimed increased duties on imports of certain articles of Japan (i.e., certain televisions, powerhand tools, and automatic data processing machines) (52 FR 13412). Effective June 16, 1987, USTR suspended increased duties on imports of 20-inch color televisions because of Japan's improved conformity with its obligations under the agreement (52 FR 22693). Effective Nov. 10, 1987, USTR suspended increased duties on imports of certain power hand tools, 18- and 19-inch color televisions, and low performance 16-bit desktop computers the product of Japan because of Japan's complete compliance with its "dumping" obligations under the Agreement (52 FR 43146). The other sanctions proclaimed on April 17, 1987, remained in effect. In October 1990, the U.S. semiconductor industry recommended to the President that the U.S. and Japan negotiate a new agreement to take effect upon expiration of the existing agreement. A new arrangement was concluded on June 11, 1991. Consequently, USTR determined that it was in the interest of the United States to suspend the increased duties upon the remainder of Japanese products subject to increased duties under Proclamation 5631, effective August 1, 1991, the date of entry into force of the 1991 Arrangement.

He directed the Trade Representative to notify the GATT of our intention to suspend tariff concessions for Brazil under Art. XVIII, and to effect such suspension when appropriate (51 FR 35993). On Dec. 30, the Trade Representative announced the President's determination to suspend the investigation with respect to Brazil's administration of its informatics policy and import restrictions, in light of improvement in these areas. However, because of insufficient progress to date in negotiations on related intellectual property protection and investment restrictions, the President announced he would determine the appropriate response of the US within six months unless a satisfactory resolution was reached (52 FR 1619). On Feb. 10, 1987, USTR announced a hearing and invited public comment on specified intellectual property and investment issues in this case (52 FR 4207). On June 30, 1987, the President suspended the intellectual property portion of the investigation based upon Brazilian legislative action toward enactment of a bill that would provide adequate copyright protection to computer software (52 FR 24971). He also directed USTR to continue the portion of the investigation regarding investment. On Nov. 13, 1987, the President announced his intention to prohibit imports of Brazilian informatics products and to raise duties or otherwise restrict imports of about $105 million in other Brazilian products. This action is in response to Brazil's breach of understandings regarding Brazil's market reserve policy, which furnished the basis for the President's suspension of the intellectual property portion of this investigation. Public comments were requested (52 FR 44939, 47071), and a hearing was held Dec. 17 and 18, 1987.

On May 15, 1986, the President imposed quotas on EC imports in response to the EC's quantitative restrictions in Portugal (51 FR 18294). On Oct. 14, 1987, the level of these quota restrictions was increased to avoid a more damaging effect on EC trade than is warranted by the current operation of the EC restrictions in Portugal (52 FR 38167). On July 2, 1986, an interim solution was reached with the EC with regard to the import levy restrictions in Spain. That solution provided that any shortfall in US corn, sorghum, and corn gluten feed exports to Spain below a monthly EC average of 234,000 metric tons through the remainder of 1986 would be compensated for through reduced import levy quotas in the EC. On Dec. 30, 1986, the US announced that unless the EC agreed to compensate the US satisfactorily by the end of January for $400 million in lost corn and sorghum exports to Spain, the President would be compelled to impose duties of 200% ad valorem on imports into the US of certain EC cheeses, ham, carrots, endive, white wine, brandy and gin-accounting for $400 million in EC exports to the US. The President proclaimed these tariff increases on Jan. 21, 1987, to take effect Jan. 30 (52 FR 2663). On Jan. 30, 1987, the US and EC settled this case. The EC agreed to ensure annual imports of corn and sorghum in Spain of 2 million and 300,000 metric tons, respectively. It also agreed to rescind its requirement in Portugal that 15 percent of the Portuguese grain market (about 400,000 metric tons) be reserved for sales from EC member countries. It further agreed to reduce duties on 26 other products (including plywood, apple and cranberry juices, and certain aluminum products), and to extend all current EC tariff bindings to Spain and Portugal. In light of these developments, the Trade Representative suspended the increased duties proclaimed Jan. 21, 1987 (52 FR 3523). On December 13, 1989, the USTR increased the levels of permissible imports, for 1989 and subsequent years, of certain ale, porter, stout and beer products that had been subject to quantitative restrictions (54 FR 51277), to avoid a more damaging effect on EC trade than was warranted by the operation of the EC restrictions in Portugal. On March 7, 1991, the EC removed its restrictions on Portuguese imports of oilseeds and vegetable articles. Effective July 8, 1991, the USTR terminated the quantitative restrictions on certain articles that had been imposed to mirror Portugal's restrictions. (56 FR 30945)

USTR initiated an investigation on May 16, 1986 (51 FR 19648), and requested comments on certain economic issues relating to the investigation. The US consulted with Canada under Art. XXIII:1 of the GATT Sept. 3 and Oct. 27, 1986, and presented arguments before a GATT dispute settlement panel on June 18 and July 10, 1987. The US won the case, and the favorable panel report was adopted by the GATT Council in February 1988. Canada announced that it would terminate its export restrictions by Jan. 1, 1989, but would adopt some new landing requirements. On August 30, 1988, a Federal Register notice (53 FR 33207) requested comments on the unfairness determination required under the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. Canada failed to remove its export prohibition by January 1, 1989, and in early 1989 the US and Canada continued to consult on Canada's plans to introduce new landing requirements. The USTR determined on March 28, 1989, that Canada's export prohibition denied U.S. rights under the GATT. At the same time the USTR sought public comment on possible trade action as a result of this determination, and directed the Section 301 Committee to hold a public hearing on such action (54 FR 13264). The hearing was held April 26. On April 25, 1989, Canada announced the replacement of the export prohibitions with landing requirements that the US considered inconsistent with Canada's obligations under both the GATT and the US-Canada Free Trade Agreement (FTA). In an exchange of letters dated May 23 and 30, 1989, the US and Canada agreed to submit the matter to expedited dispute settlement under the FTA. On October 13, 1989, the FTA Panel issued its report finding the landing requirements violate FTA Article 407. The parties began consultations on October 16, 1989, to reach agreement on an amendment to Canada's current landing requirement that would conform with the FTA or that otherwise constitutes a satisfactory resolution of the dispute. In mid-February 1990, the United States and Canada reached agreement on an interim settlement of the dispute. Under that arrangement, U.S. buyers will be able to purchase 20 percent of British Columbia (B.C.) roe herring and salmon directly from B.C. fishing grounds during the 1990 fishing season. The percentage will increase to 25 percent during 1991-93. Under the arrangement, roe herring shipped to the United States from Canada would have to be processed before re-export to third countries, to the same extent as Canada requires under its domestic law. Canada and the United States will review the operation of this arrangement in 1993. The investigation was terminated on June 1, 1990 (55 FR 23322).

On Feb. 20, 1987, USTR initiated an investigation and requested consultations with India (52 FR 6412 and 7057). The US consulted with India under GATT Art. XXIII:1 in June and September. USTR requested the establishment of a panel under Art. XXIII:2 at the GATT Councils in July, October and November. The US also raised almonds issues in the full consultations with India held in the GATT Balance of Payments Committee in October. In November 1987, the GATT Council agreed to the establishment of a panel. In May 1988, a satisfactory bilateral settlement was reached and USTR terminated the investigation (53 FR 21757). The Indian Government established a separate quota for almonds, which increases access to that market, to the satisfaction of US industry. Moreover, India agreed to eliminate the quota in three years if its balance of payment position improves as specified in the Agreement. India also reduced and bound its tariff for shelled almonds and bound its tariff on unshelled almonds.

On July 23, 1987, USTR initiated an investigation and requested consultations with Brazil (52 FR 28223). Consultations were held on Feb. 29, 1988, and additional discussions resulted in no resolution. On July 21, 1988, the President determined Brazil's policy to be unreasonable and a burden and restriction on US commerce, and he directed USTR to hold public hearings (See 53 FR 28100 and 30894) on certain products exported from Brazil. Hearings were held September 8-9, 1988. On October 20, 1988 the President used section 301 authority to proclaim tariff increases to 100 % ad valorem on certain paper products, non-benzenoid drugs, and consumer electronics items, effective October 30, 1988 (53 FR 41551). On June 26, 1990, the Government of Brazil announced that the President of Brazil had decided to seek legislation to provide patent protection for pharmaceutical products and the process of their production. The Brazilian Administration will ensure the presentation of a bill to the Brazilian National Congress for this purpose by March 20, 1991, and will seek its approval and implement such legislation immediately after it comes into force. The USTR therefore determined that Brazil was taking satisfactory measures to eliminate the practices that were determined by the President to be unreasonable and a burden or restriction on U.S. commerce. On June 27, 1990, the USTR announced that she had determined that it was in the interest of the United States to terminate the application of the increased duties imposed by Proclamation No. 5885, pursuant to the authority granted to the USTR in that Proclamation. Such termination was made effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 12:01 a.m. on July 2, 1990 (55 FR 27324) The USTR also announced that she would monitor closely the Government of Brazil's efforts to enact such legislation.

On Nov. 25, 1987, the President announced his intention to raise customs duties to a prohibitive level on as much as $100 million in EC exports to the US This action was in response to the implementation scheduled for Jan. 1, 1988 of the Animal Hormone Directive. Without valid scientific evidence, this directive would ban imports of meat produced from animals treated with growth hormones. However, the President said he would suspend increased duties if EC member states continued to allow such imports for a 12-month transition period.

On Dec. 24, 1987, on his own motion, the President proclaimed but immediately suspended increased duties on specified products of the EC (52 FR 49131), pending EC implementation of its Directive. He delegated authority to modify, suspend or terminate the increased duties (including to terminate the suspension of such increased duties) to the Trade Representative. The EC implemented its directive on January 1, 1989. In response, the USTR terminated the suspension of the increased duties, effective January 1, 1989, with some modifications (53 FR 53115). The US and EC agreed on January 12 to allow a grace period for goods exported, or meat certified for export, prior to January 1, if they entered before February 1 (54 FR 3032). On February 18, the US and EC established a task force of high- level government officials to seek a resolution to the hormones dispute by May 4, 1989. In May the task force's mandate was extended and its work continues. Effective July 28, 1989, the USTR suspended the additional duty on pork hams and shoulders (54 FR 31398), since the EC had enabled non-treated U.S. beef to enter the EC. Effective December 8, 1989, the USTR suspended the application of the increased duty on imports of certain tomato sauces from the European Community (54 FR 50673), and on May 16, 1990, made a technical amendment to the subheadings on tomato sauces (55 FR 20376). On May 20, 1996, based on a request from the United States, the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) of the World Trade Organization (WTO) established a dispute settlement panel to examine whether the Directive is consistent with the EC and its member states obligations under various WTO Agreements (61 FR 33149). As the United States now had effective multilateral procedures to address the matter of the EC's restrictions on imports of U.S. meat under the Directive, the USTR on July 12, 1996, determined that it was in the interest of the United States to terminate, effective July 15, 1996, the increased duties proclaimed in Proclamation No. 5759 and applied pursuant to the authority delegated to the USTR in Proclamation No. 5759.

The USTR proposed to determine that the EC had taken no measures to implement WTO recommendations. Such a determination required the USTR to decide what further recommendations to take under 301(a) in the event the EC fails to implement the WTO recommendations by May 13, 1999 (64 FR 14486 of 03/25/99). On March 22, 1999, the USTR published a preliminary list of products in preparation of exercising U.S. WTO rights on the beef trade issue (USTR Press Release 99-27 of 03/22/99). The USTR requested written comments and invited testimony for a public hearing set for April 13, 1999, on its proposed determination to place duties on selected products should the EC fail to implement the WTO recommendations (62 FR 14486 of 03/25/99). Since the EU failed to comply with WTO recommendations, the U.S. formally notified the DSB on May 14, 1999, of its intention to exercise its WTO rights to suspend trade concessions to the EU with regard to products covering US$202 million worth of trade in accordance with WTO procedures. The final list of products will be drawn from the preliminary list published in the Federal Register on March 25, 1999. This final list will be published in the Federal Register following WTO authorization and will correspond in value to the WTO-authorized damage amount. Under WTO dispute settlement procedures, the U.S. request for WTO authorization to suspend trade concessions must be granted by June 12, 1999, unless the EU claims that the amount of concessions exceeds the amount of harm caused to U.S. exports. If the EU makes such a claim, the amount proposed by the U.S. will be submitted to arbitration, which must be concluded by July 12. Then the U.S. can resubmit its request and may adjust the amount in order to be consistent with arbitration (USTR Press Release 99-43 of 05/14/99).

On Jan. 5, 1988, USTR initiated an investigation and requested consultations with the EC (53 FR 984). The US consulted with the EC several times, both informally and formally, under GATT Art. XXIII:1. The EC blocked the US request for a panel at the May 1988 GATT Council, but acquiesced at the June 1988 Council. However, the EC delayed composition of the panel for several months with a number of procedural maneuvers. The first oral arguments before the panel were held June 27, 1989. On July 5, 1989, USTR determined that there was reason to believe that rights of the United States under a trade agreement were being denied by the EC's production and processing subsidies on oilseeds and animal feed proteins. USTR delayed implementation of any action to be taken under section 301 and may reconsider these determinations in light of the GATT Panel's findings. The panel ruled in favor of the United States, in a report that was circulated to GATT Contracting Parties on December 14, 1989. Following release of the report, the EC Foreign Affairs Council expressed its readiness to accept the GATT panel conclusions and to adapt the Community regulations within the framework of the implementation of the results of the Uruguay Round; and the USTR was advised that the necessary measures to comply with the panel's conclusions would be in place for the crop year beginning in 1991. On January 25, 1990, the panel report was adopted by consensus by the GATT Council of Representatives, and the EC representative confirmed the EC's intention to take measures to comply with the panel's conclusions. On January 31, 1990, consistent with the panel's conclusions, the USTR determined under section 304(a)(1)(A)(i), that rights of the United States under a trade agreement are being denied by, inter alia, the EC's production and processing subsidies on oilseeds and animal feed proteins and the practices resulting therefrom, within the meaning of section 301(a)(1)(A), and that EC production subsidies deny benefits to the United States within the meaning of section 301(a)(1)(B)(i). The Trade Representative also found that the EC had agreed to take satisfactory measures, within the meaning of section 301(a)(2)(B)(i), to grant the rights of the United States under a trade agreement. Therefore, the USTR determined pursuant to section 304(a)(1)(B) that the appropriate action at that time was to conclude the investigation of this matter initiated under section 302(a) of the Trade Act, and, in accordance with section 306(a) of the Trade Act, to monitor implementation by the EC of its commitment to take satisfactory measures by the 1991 marketing year to comply with the panel report (55 FR 4294). On March 16, 1992, the reconvened panel issued a "follow-up" report that confirmed that the EC's new subsidies regime still did not satisfy its GATT obligations and was continuing to impair duty-free tariff bindings on oilseeds. On June 12, 1992, USTR requested public comment on a proposed determination of of action, pursuant to sections 301(a) and 306(b) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended. (57 FR 25087) A public hearing was held on July 13-14, 1992, for the purpose of hearing views on possible action being considered.

XXIII:2. Australia was also authorized a panelon the same matter, so consultations on panel selection included coordination between two panels. The first panel meeting was November 28, 1988; the second meeting was January 20, 1989. The panel issued a report favorable to the US on May 27. However, at GATT Council meetings in June and July 1989, Korea did not agree to adoption of the panel report. Public comment on section 304 determinations was requested August 25, 1989 (54 FR 35422). Effective September 28, 1989, the USTR determined under section 304 that rights to which the U.S. is entitled are being denied by Korea and that the appropriate action under section 301 is to suspend tariff concessions. (54 FR 40769.) Implementation of such action was delayed to allow additional time for the GATT process. The USTR announced that if there were no substantial movement toward a resolution by mid-November, a proposed retaliation list would be published. However, on November 8, 1989, Korea allowed the GATT panel report to be adopted, and consultations commenced thereafter on an acceptable implementation by Korea of the panel results. Following several rounds of negotiations on Korea's implementation of the GATT panel findings, on March 21, 1990, an agreement was initialled between the United States and the Republic of Korea, and on April 26-27, 1990, letters were exchanged. On April 26, 1990, the section 302 investigation was terminated (55 FR 20376).

Consultations with Japan were requested, to be scheduled following a public hearing. A hearing was held March 13, 1989 (54 FR 2033), and consultations with the Japanese began on May 23, 1989. On November 21, 1989, the USTR determined, pursuant to section 304(a)(1)(A) of the Trade Act, that certain acts, policies and practices of the Government of Japan with respect to the procurement of architectural, engineering and construction services and related consulting services by the Japanese Government are unreasonable and burden or restrict U.S. commerce (54 FR 49150). The USTR further determined, pursuant to section 304(a)(1)(B) of the Trade Act, that no responsive action under section 301 of the Act was appropriate at that time in light of certain commitments made by the Government of Japan. The USTR announced that she would monitor Japan's implementation of these commitments pursuant to section 306 of the Trade Act, and would seek a satisfactory resolution of all remaining concerns in ongoing bilateral negotiations, beginning January 19, 1990, and including a full review in May 1990 of the "Major Projects Arrangements" concluded by the United States and Japan in 1988.

Notice of the proposed action was published in the Federal Register on May 1, 1991, (56 FR 20057), and public comment was solicited.

USTR requested public comment and on June 9, 1989 held a public hearing (54 FR 20219) on whether the EC practice is actionable under section 301, including whether it violates a trade agreement; and, if so, on the appropriateness of subjecting certain products of the EC to increased US tariffs. In June 1989 the EC agreed to reduce its 1989-90 subsidy levels on canned peaches and pears and to modify its regulations for future years; and the U.S. and EC clarified their interpretation of the 1985 Canned Fruit Agreement.

A public hearing was held September 19, 1989 (54 FR 32731). Further consultations wereheld in October 1989. On December 22, the United States requested consultations under Article XXIII:1 of the GATT. Since those consultations failed to result in a satisfactory solution, the United States requested the establishment of panel under GATT Article XXIII:2. The panel was established on April 3, 1990, and issued its report on September 21, 1990, concluding that Thailand's import restrictions on cigarettes are contrary to the provisions of GATT Article XI. On November 7, 1992, the GATT Council adopted this report Pursuant to section 304 of the Trade Act, the deadline for determining actionability under section 301 in this case was November 25, 1990. On October 15, public comment was requested on the section 304 determinations (55 FR 41781). On November 23, 1990, the USTR determined that U.S. rights under the GATT were violated by Thailand's restrictions on imports of cigarettes, but in light of subsequent actions and commitments of the Royal ThaiGovernment, the USTR decided to terminate the investigation on the same date, and to monitor Thai implementation under section 306(a) of the Trade Act.

On October 6, 1989, the US requested formal consultations with Brazil under Article XXIII:1 of the GATT. Those consultations were held in Geneva on December 11, 1989. During consultations, Brazil indicated its intent to significantly reduce the "prohibited" import list and expand the de facto quotas. Some minor liberalization of the de facto quotas occurred in February 1990. However, when action to reduce the "prohibited" import list did not occur, the United States informed Brazil of its intention to request dispute settlement proceedings under GATT Article XXIII:2 if no resolution was forthcoming. On May 14, 1990, the USTR was informed by the Government of Brazil that its Ministry of Economy had implemented Resolution Number 56, issued March 15, 1990, which eliminates quantitative restrictions on imports. In particular, the "prohibited list" of imports that was the subject of this investigation (Annex C of CACEX Communique 205, originally established in 1976) has been abolished. The Government of Brazil also informed the USTR that its new external trade policy will rely on tariffs as the main regulatory instrument for Brazilian imports, rather than quantitative restrictions, thus giving the Brazilian import regime transparency and predictability. In light of the foregoing, on May 21, 1990, the USTR terminated the investigation initiated pursuant to section 302(b)(1) of the Trade Act, because the practices that were the subject of the investigation had been removed (55 FR 22876).

Also on that date the US requested consultations with Canada under Article XXIII:1 of the GATT. Consultations were held July 20, 1990. On September 14, 1990, the Stroh Brewing Company filed a petition complaining about the distribution and pricing practices of the Province of Ontario with respect to imported beer. On October 17, 1990, the USTR decided to investigate the allegations contained in the Stroh petition in the context of this investigation. On February 6, 1991, the matter was referred to a GATT dispute settlement panel, which issued its report on October 16, 1991. On December 29, 1991, USTR determined consistent with a GATT panel finding that acts, policies, or practices of Canada violate the provisions of a trade agreement (specifically, the GATT) and that action shall be taken in the form of substantially increased duties on beer and malt beverages from Canada sufficient to offset fully the nullification or impairment of GATT rights resulting from these Canadian acts, policies or practices. The USTR further determined that, pursuant to section 305(a)(2) of the Trade Act, it is desirable to implement such action no later than April 10, 1992 (57 FR 308). On April 14, 1992, USTR instructed the U.S. Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all entries of Canadian beer. USTR also announced that it would delay imposition of increased duties pending the outcome of further negotiations, but that any increased duties would be imposed retroactively upon all entries after April 13, 1992. Following intense negotiations USTR lifted the suspension on April 25, 1992. On July 24, 1992, USTR imposed increased duties of 50 percent ad valorem, effective immediately, on imports of Canadian beer brewed or bottled in the Province of Ontario. USTR also instructed the interagency Section 301 Committee to monitor imports of beer from Canada to determine whether imports from provinces other than Ontario are increasing significantly, which would indicate that beer was being diverted from Ontario to other provinces for exportation to the United States. If it appears that beer is being diverted from Ontario to other provinces, the USTR may issue a modified determination pursuant to section 307 of the Trade Act to impose additional duties upon imports of beer from those provinces. (57 FR 33747). On August 5, 1993 pursuant to section 307(a)(1) the USTR terminated the section 301 action in view of Canada's agreement to provide satisfactory terms of access for U.S. Beer to the Ontario market. USTR will monitor implementation pursuant to section 306 of the Trade Act.

On May 31, 1991, USTR invited public comments on the matters being investigated (56 FR 24878), and requested consultations with the PRC government. On November 26, 1991, USTR determined that complex or complicated issues were involved in the investigation that it required additional time, thus USTR's determinations under section 304(a)(1) on actionability and what action, if any, should be taken in response must be made no later than February 26, 1992 (56 FR 61447). On December 2, 1991, USTR requested public comment on a proposed determination that certain acts, policies and practices of the People's Republic of China with respect to its protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights are unreasonable and constitute a burden or restriction on United States commerce (56 FR 61278). The USTR also sought public comment on appropriate action under section 301 in response to these acts, policies, and practices. A public hearing was held on January 6-7, 1992, for the purpose of hearing views on possible action being considered in response to the People's Republic of China's intellectual property laws, policies, and practices (56 FR 64280). On January 17, 1992, USTR decided to terminate the investigation initiated under section 302 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, with respect to the intellectual property laws and practices of the People's Republic of China, having reached a satisfactory resolution of the issues. In addition, USTR revoked China's identification as a priority foreign country under section 182 of the Trade Act, as amended (section 1303 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988).

On October 4, 1991, USTR invited public comments on the matters being investigated (56 FR 50738). Because expeditious action was required, the USTR made these determinations prior to receiving public comment in accordance with section 304(b)(1). The Administration announced the following action: (1) intention to self-initiate a countervailing duty investigation of softwood lumber imports from Canada (which was in fact initiated on October 31, 1991); and (2) until preliminary results of that investigation are available, interim customs suspension of liquidation to prevent disruption of the U.S. lumber market as a consequence of the abrupt termination of the MOU undertaking. On March 6, 1992, the Department of Commerce issued an affirmative preliminary determination in the countervailing duty investigation. Consequently, the bond requirement imposed by the Section 301 investigation was terminated. Meanwhile, Canada challenged the initiation of the 301 and countervailing duty investigations before the GATT. On October 19, 1994, USTR terminated Section 301 action and ordered the Customs service to cease the extension of liquidation in light of the completion of the binational panel proceedings under the US-Canada Free Trade Agreement (59 FR 52846). On May 29, 1996, the United States and Canada entered into an agreement on trade in softwood lumber, with effect from April 1, 1996. This agreement is intended to provide a satisfactory resolution to this matter. The USTR determined that this agreement will be subject to the provisions of section 306 of the Trade Act and that USTR will monitor Canadian compliance with this agreement pursuant to section 306 of the Trade Act and will take action under section 301(a) if Canada fails to comply with it (61 FR 28626).

On June 30, 1994, USTR invited public comment on the matters being investigated and requested consultations with the Chinese government (59 FR 35558). On December 31, 1994, USTR determined that as complex or complicated issues were involved in the investigation, requiring additional time, the investigation should be extended to February 4, 1995 (60 FR 1829). On the same date, the USTR also requested public comment on proposed determinations on the actionability under section 301 of the practices under investigations and on appropriate action under section 301 in response to them. A public hearing was held on January 24-25 to hear views on the proposed action. On February 4, 1995, the USTR determined pursuant to section 304(a) that certain acts, policies and practices of China with respect to its protection of intellectual property rights and the provision of market access to persons who rely on intellectual property rights protection was unreasonable and discriminatory and constituted a burden or restriction on U.S. commerce. The USTR also determined that the appropriate action in response was, pursuant to section 301 (b) and (c), to increase duties to 100 percent ad valorem on certain products of China entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after February 26, 1995. As a result of a February 25, 1995, agreement reached between the United States and China on the protection of intellectual property and related market access issues, the USTR terminated the investigation; announced monitoring of the agreement under section 306 of the Trade Act; terminated the order to impose sanctions on Chinese products; and revoked China's designation as a priority foreign country. On May 15, 1996, based on monitoring carried out under section 306(a), the Acting USTR considered that China was not satisfactorily implementing the February 25, 1995 agreement. In light of this, the Acting USTR proposed to impose prohibitive tariffs on imports of certain products from China and requested public comment and announced a public hearing to be held on June 6 and 7, 1996. Additionally, to prevent surges the Acting USTR directed the Commissioner of Customs to limit by date of export entries of certain textile products, over the next 30-day period, to 15 percent of the 1996 adjusted level for each category of product. On June 12, 1996, the USTR extended her directive for an additional 30-day period commencing on June 14, 1996 On June 17, 1996, the USTR announced that, based on the measurers that China has taken and will take in the future to implement key elements of the 1995 Agreement, the proposed sanctions would not be imposed. In addition, the USTR determined to revoke China's designation as a "Priority Foreign Country" under section 182 of the Trade Act. The USTR determined that the limitation on textile and apparel imports to prevent import surges should be terminated and directed the Commissioner of Customs accordingly.

The USTR invited public comment on the acts, policies and practices of the EU and pursuant to section 303(a) of the Trade Act, requested consultations with the EU pursuant to the WTO's Understanding on Rules and Procedures Concerning the Settlement of Disputes (DSU) (60 FR 52027 of 10/04/95). On May 8, 1996, the DSB established a panel in response to the April 11, 1996, panel request filed jointly and severally by Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and the United States. A WTO dispute settlement Panel was subsequently formed to address this dispute, and, in a report circulated in May 1997 found in favor of the United States. The findings in the report were affirmed by the WTO Appellate Body on September 9, 1997, and adopted by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body on September 25, 1997. On December 17, 1997, the EC stated its intention to comply with its international obligations and to implement all the rulings and recommendations in the WTO reports by January 1, 1999. In light of the foregoing, the USTR did not take action under section 301 of the Trade Act and terminated its investigation on February 10, 1998. (63 FR 8248, 02/18/98)

January 1, 1999 was the deadline for the EU to implement recommendations of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) concerning the EU banana regime. The USTR had to make the determination no later than January 31, 1999, as to whether the EU had undertaken the appropriate measures (63 FR 56687 of 10/22/98).

The USTR proposed to determine that the measures the EC had taken had failed to implement the WTO recommendations. Such a determination required the USTR to decide what further action to take under 301(a) in the event the EC had failed to implement the WTO recommendations by January 1, 1999. The USTR intended to determine by December 15, 1998, what action to take (63 FR 56689 of 10/22/98). The USTR requested written comments and invited testimony for a public hearing set for December 9, 1998, on its proposed determination to place prohibitive duties on selected products should the EC fail to implement the WTO recommendations. The USTR intended to publish a notice on Decmber 15, 1998, describing the actions that it would take beginning February 1, 1999 (63 FR 63099 of 11/10/98). On December 21, 1998, the USTR announced in a press release the list of EC products for which the USTR intended to request authorization from the WTO to impose 100% ad valorem duties (63 FR 71665 of 12/29/98). On January 14, 1999, the USTR requested authorization from the WTO to suspend tariff concessions on certain products of the EU (USTR press release 99-01 of 01/14/99). Written comments were due on January 13, 1999, concerning the possible imposition of prohibitive (100% ad valorem) duties on certain items. In addition, the USTR asked for written comments by the same deadline in regards to the possible inclusion of more products to the list of items to suspend tariff concessions (63 FR 71665 of 12/29/98). The EU requested WTO arbitration on the amount of the U.S. proposed suspension of concessions, which the U.S. had estimated at US$520 million. According to WTO rules, the arbitration must be completed before March 2, and then the WTO will authorize the U.S. suspension of concessions immediately thereafter (USTR press release 99-11 of 01/29/99). On March 2 the arbitrators issued only an initial decision and requested further information from the parties. On March 3, the USTR announced that the U.S. Customs Service would begin withholding liquidation and reviewing the sufficiency of bonds on imports of selected European products in order for the U.S. to be in the same position as it would have had the arbitrators issued their decision by the deadline (64 FR 19209 of 04/19/99). On April 6, 1999, the arbitrators issued their final decision determining that the U.S. could suspend tariff concessions by $191.4 million per year (64 FR 19209 of 04/19/99). On April 9, 1999, the USTR announced the final retaliatory product list (USTR Press Release 99-35 of 04/09/99).

The USTR invited public comments on the matters being investigated and participation in a public hearing concerning the proposed determinations and action. (62 FR 60299 of 11/7/97) On March 16, 1998, the USTR determined pursuant to sections 304(a)(1)(A) and 301(b) of the Trade Act that, based on the failure of the Government of Honduras to provide adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights, certain acts, policies, and practices of Honduras with respect to the protection of intellectual property rights are unreasonable and burden or restrict United States commerce. Pursuant to sections 304(a)(1)(B), 301(b) and 301(c) of the Trade Act, the USTR also determined that the appropriate action to obtain the elimination of such acts, policies, and practices is to suspend effective April 20, 1998, the preferential treatment accorded under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) programs to certain fruit and vegetable products of Honduras. (63 FR 16607 of 4/3/98) On June 30, 1998, USTR terminated action taken under Section 301 (b) of the Trade Act, in recognition of the Government of Honduras' recent progress in combating piracy and protecting intellectual property rights of the United States. This action restores the GSP and CBI trade benefits which were suspended by the USTR's March decision. The USTR will continue to monitor Honduras' compliance in protecting the intellectual property rights of the United States pursuant to Section 306 of the Trade Act.(63 FR 35633 of 6/30/98)

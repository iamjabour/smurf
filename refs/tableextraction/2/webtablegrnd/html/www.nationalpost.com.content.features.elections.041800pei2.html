Results on island spell bad news for Chrétien
</b>
<br ></br>
15% of voters shift allegiance from Liberals to Tories

In Charlottetown
<p >
What if little Prince Edward Island was sending the rest of the country a message last night? It's happened before. I think it just happened again. If Jean Chrétien and his palace guard didn't already have their hands full with trouble in the Middle East, I think they would be pondering the results from the Much Nearer East this morning with real concern.
</p>
<p >
The next federal election is about as far in the future as the last one was in 1996 when Pat Binns unseated the provincial Liberals to win election as Prince Edward Island's Premier for the first time. Back then other Canadians, well used to ignoring the smallest province, attached no particular importance to the Tory bean farmer's surprising triumph.
</p>
<p >
But when voting day came for the rest of us in 1997, the P.E.I. pattern repeated throughout the Atlantic provinces. Mr. Binns had run on anger against the feds' social program cuts and employment insurance reform. That anger cost the Liberals seats across the region, including those held by two senior cabinet ministers, David Dingwall and Doug Young, and every single seat in Nova Scotia. The bloodbath nearly cost the Liberals their parliamentary majority.
</p>
<p >
Since then the Liberal assumption has been that the party can balance losses in the rest of the country with gains in the Atlantic. Surely things could only get better.
</p>
<p >
Now it appears they can get worse.
</p>
<p >
In a nutshell, what happened last night was that about 15% of Island voters shifted their vote from the Liberals to the Tories. That was enough to firm up Mr. Binns' already healthy majority, slash the little Liberal caucus, and probably end the political career of Wayne Carew, the excitable Liberal who was handed his party's leadership last year when nobody else wanted it.
</p>
<p >
Now before I go on drawing national lessons from local events, let me count the reasons P.E.I. may
<i >
not
</i>
be a harbinger. First, this time none of the Island's party leaders hauled federal politics into the provincial campaign. The premier didn't run against Ottawa, and Mr. Carew didn't present himself as the Island's dispensary of federal bounty.
</p>
<p >
Second, Mr. Carew ran a pretty rotten campaign. Several commentators read the second half of the Liberal campaign slogan -- "It's the Island way" -- to mean, "C'mon, you owe us." The Liberals, as Mr. Carew took absurd pleasure in repeating, governed P.E.I. for 70 of the last 100 years. As though brand loyalty still mattered in today's warp-speed politics. Mr. Carew was an unlikely figure to stage an upset.
</p>
<p >
But still. What are the federal Liberals proposing to run on, in the next election, besides brand loyalty? If Mr. Chrétien peddles stories about Wilfrid Laurier out here, as he did at last month's federal Liberal convention, how different will he sound from Mr. Carew?
</p>
<p >
Last night's results, if they can be generalized across the region, are bad news not only for the Liberals against other parties, but for Mr. Chrétien as he continues to face grumbling about his right to fight a third election.
</p>
<p >
First the party as a whole. The Liberals hold 101 of 103 seats in Ontario, a full two-thirds of the party's national caucus. Most Liberals think simple slippage and boredom will cost them a few seats there.
</p>
<p >
But if Tom Long, the man who ran Mike Harris' last two provincial campaigns, wins the Canadian Alliance leadership -- or even if he loses honourably and throws his active support behind the winner -- the Liberals' fortunes in Ontario look far shakier. Remember, barely a half-dozen seats separate the Liberals from a minority government.
</p>
<p >
Where do they make up the losses? Alberta? Please. British Columbia? Anyone who bets anything on B.C., either way, has a gambling problem. Quebec? There, more than anywhere else in the country, a handful of rogue Liberals refuse to shut up about how the party cannot make any gains under Mr. Chrétien.
</p>
<p >
So welcome to Canada's ocean playground. Already before the P.E.I. vote, federal Liberals were saying they've seen no gains in public opinion polls since 1997. Michael Marzolini, the relentlessly chipper party pollster, still can't identify a single safe Liberal seat in Nova Scotia.
</p>
<p >
To win those seats, the Liberals will face federal Tories fighting with a strength born of desperation. The draft policy book released last week suggests Joe Clark will promise gold-plated fisherman's wharves if he must to protect his Eastern flank.
</p>
<p >
The Liberals look to be hitting a wall out here. Trouble, specifically, for Mr. Chrétien. He is showing in the Middle East that he doesn't travel well, can't bounce back from self-inflicted adversity -- in short, that he's at least as shaky a campaigner as he was in 1997 and in the 1995 Quebec referendum. What's more, he's lost the press gallery's patience.
</p>
<p >
If he loses Ontario, and cannot hope to gain in the Atlantic, how persuasive is his argument for staying?

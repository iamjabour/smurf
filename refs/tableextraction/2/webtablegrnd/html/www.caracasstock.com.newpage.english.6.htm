Review of 1999 and Perspectives for 2000
</font>
</p>
<font  arial="#DEFAULT" color="#000000" face="Verdana," helvetica="#DEFAULT" size="2">
<p  align="justify">
The Caracas Stock Exchange, in its fifty-third year of existence, has again been influenced, as happens in any globalized and interdependent economy, by fluctuations in international markets and by the current reality of the Venezuelan economy, characterized by a profound recession.
</p>
<p  align="justify">
In the year 1999 changes occurred in the country arising from the constituent process, and economic aspects remained relegated to a secondary plane while a new political framework was being defined. Factors such as the economic crises affecting other Latin American countries connected with Venezuela also contributed to a withdrawal of foreign investors from the market.
</p>
<p  align="left">
<b >
THE ECONOMIC SHRINKAGE
</b>
</p>
<p  align="justify">
Economic contraction, begun several years ago, became more acute in 1999. Results were disheartening. The economy did not even manage to recover after the extraordinary increase in the price of petroleum exports. Decreases in production, consumption, investments and company profits (even losses), closing of many commercial and industrial companies, and an increase in unemployment again could be seen. Even though a slowed inflation rate must be noted as a positive factor, it continues high at 20.1% at year-end, although under that of 1998 and 1997, which was 29.9% and 37.6%, respectively.
</p>
<p  align="justify">
According to Venezuelan Central Bank estimates, the year ended with a variation of the Gross National Product of 7.2%, due specially to cuts in crude oil production, which followed the market, and sharp contraction in investment and consumption which affected behavior of non-petroleum activities.
</p>
<p  align="justify">
Private investment was reduced by 24.9%, the unemployment index increased to 15.4%, reaching some 51.7% for the population working in the informal sector. The drop in agricultural production of 0.7% was accompanied by severe contraction in the sectors which generate the most employment in the country- construction (-20.5%), manufacturing HOC, and commerce, (- 16.5%).
</p>
<p  align="justify">
It must be pointed out that these figures, supplied at year-end, still do not reflect the repercussions of the natural tragedy which occurred in December, with devastating mud slides and floods, of a gravity without precedent in important zones of the country.
</p>
<p  align="left">
<b >
DECREASE IN AMOUNTS TRADED AND STOCK MARKET MIGRATION
</b>
</p>
<p  align="justify">
In this rather complex environment, the securities market which evolved during 1999 was affected by a multiplicity of other factors as well, leading to a strong decrease in volumes and total amounts traded, the number of operations, and in the market capitalization. Three factors had an important bearing on the results obtained:
</p>
<p  align="left">
<b >
A - Bank Debit Tax
</b>
</p>
<p  align="justify">
One of the factors which most contributed to the situation described above was the application of the Bank Debit Tax in the mediation chain of the Caracas Stock Exchange, making trades more expensive since an additional 2% must be added to the 1% stock transfer tax, without counting other taxes.
</p>
<p  align="justify">
This situation caused liquidity to be transferred to the New York Exchange, where thirteen equities of some of the most important Venezuelan companies are traded under the ADR format. Already 75% of the trades in these securities is made in New York, and only a quarter part is carried out in the local market.
</p>
<p  align="justify">
Consequently, the amount entering the national treasury via the 1% tax decreased from 7,565.4 million bolivars in 1998 to 5,510.5 million in 1999, i.e., a difference of 2,054 million bolivars (-27%).
</p>
<p  align="justify">
There has also been a drastic reduction in the number of brokerage houses active on the Caracas Stock Exchange. Of 63 houses, only 44 were active in 1999, with the consequent impact on the employment level in the Venezuelan securities industry.
</p>
<p  align="left">
<b >
B - Transfer, settlement and clearance operations
</b>
</p>
<p  align="justify">
Another factor bearing upon the move of trades in Venezuelan securities to New York is the difference in the time required for transfer, settling and clearance operations in the two centers. Our market does not meet the international standard of T+3 recommended as a minimum by the Group of Thirty and other international bodies, and therefore is at a competitive disadvantage.
</p>
<p  align="justify">
An improvement in rapidity and openness of these procedures could have been achieved at least partially as of November, 1999 if the National Securities Commission had not postponed the Caracas Stock Exchange decision to settle all trades through the Venezuelan Central Depository (CVV). On Friday, November 12th, 1999, the last trading date before the Exchange resolution would enter into effect, the National Securities Commission, in Decree # 309, postponed the execution of our decision for an indefinite period.
</p>
<p  align="left">
<b >
C - Mechanisms of delivery against payment
</b>
</p>
<p  align="justify">
A third reason for the move of the market abroad, and no less important, is the delay by the Venezuelan Central Bank to implement the mechanism of payment value today, so that another Group of Thirty recommendation can be fulfilled in Venezuela which has been welcomed worldwide: Delivery versus payment.
</p>
<p  align="justify">
In this scenario, the Caracas Stock Exchange was forced to reduce its expenses in a significant manner, although maintaining its capability to continue rendering quality service, but having to postpone new investments and to confront its responsibilities with fewer financial and human resources during this prolonged stage of market contraction.
</p>
<p  align="left">
<b >
Conclusions
</b>
</p>
<p  align="justify">
The shares market is being overly punished by the concurrence of numerous factors hindering its development.
</p>
<p  align="justify">
As to fixed income, even though advances were registered in dematerialization of securities, by application of the corresponding dispositions of the current Capital Markets Law as well as by creation of a market of dematerialized certificates in the Central Bank, channeling them through the Exchange was not achieved in 1999.
</p>
<p  align="left">
For the year 2000:
</p>
<p  align="justify">
We anticipate that the Venezuelan securities market may be able to resume its growth pattern on a firm and stable basis, for which a body of laws must be decreed which defines the legal framework of economic, labor, and tax relationships, as well as clarifying the subject of pension funds and promoting and giving incentive to institutions and entities operating in the market.
</p>
<p  align="justify">
We are equally confident that the National Securities Commission will consider the convenience of allowing shares, bonds and obligations traded on the stock market to be transferred in an electronic manner, as per the dispositions of the Capital Markets Law and Central Depository Law, giving alacrity to the settlement of all transactions.
</p>
<p  align="justify">
Finally, it is hoped that the Venezuelan Government culminates a complete and coherent program for placements and management of public debt securities and other instruments of fiscal policy, and that the Venezuelan Central Bank approves mechanisms of "value today" in order to achieve the goal of delivery against payment to allow the capital market to be on a par with other Latin American countries in this respect.

RELEVANT ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF 1999
</font>
</b>
</p>
<p  align="left">
<b >
1999: Year of technological consolidation in the Caracas Stock Exchange
</b>
</p>
<p  align="justify">
This was the year of consolidating changes in our technological platform, upon completion of the 34.1% remaining of the Investment Plan begun last year. Installation of the Integrated Electronic Trading System (SIBE), acquired through a cooperation agreement with the Madrid Stock Exchange, was completed and adapted to the Venezuelan market in substitution of the Automated System of Stock Market Trades (SATB) in operation since 1992, which also meant successfully surmounting the so-called "Y2K".
</p>
<p  align="justify">
Fixed and Variable Income securities registered in the Caracas Stock Exchange were incorporated into this system.
</p>
<p  align="justify">
On May 7 the Fixed Income Module was placed in operation which affords an electronic mechanism for trades in TEM, National Pubic Debt Bonds (DPN), Treasury Notes, Certificates of Deposit, Brady Bonds, Global depository receipts, commercial paper and other instruments, with all trades on the Exchange being incorporated into the SIBE when the Variable Securities Module was put into service subsequently.
</p>
<p  align="justify">
On July 2 the official act of inaugurating the SIBE and the Infobolsa network was held, with the presence of José María Aznar, President of Spain, José Vicente Rangel, Chancellor of the Republic in representation of the Government of Venezuela, the Presidents of the Caracas and Madrid Stock Exchanges, representatives of the National Securities Commission, Venezuelan Central Bank, Fedecamaras and other entities of political and financial scope of the two countries, who shared the occasion with directors, shareholders and brokers of the Caracas Stock Exchange.
</p>
<p  align="justify">
The SIBE started with 50 workstations in brokerage houses and another 30 stations located on the trading floor of the Caracas Stock Exchange, creating a mechanism of second generation information technology at the service of openness of the market, in rendering greater rapidity, scope and reliability to operations.
</p>
<p  align="justify">
The Infobolsa network, designed by the Society for Broadcasting Information of the Madrid Stock Exchange, which operates successfully in various countries and is now offered to the Venezuelan investment public, began functioning in Caracas this year. Infobolsa of America, via the Caracas Stock Exchange, offers a mechanism to broadcast data and market news which has filled a void, since it adds local focus to that traditionally offered by the more advanced information services in the world. Use of this new platform in its aspects of trading as well as broadcasting permits immediate incorporation of Venezuela into the electronic markets operating today in Europe and North America.
</p>
<p  align="left">
<b >
International Presence
</b>
</p>
<p  align="justify">
In 1999 the Caracas Stock Exchange continued its active participation in the International Federation of Stock Exchanges (Fiabv), in whose executive committee it has been a member since 1995 and through which studies and activities are promoted for the welfare of the group of Exchanges in America and Europe forming part of this international organization. In the XXVI Meeting held in Buenos Aires this past October, the President of the Caracas Stock Exchange was elected Vice President of this Federation.
</p>
<p  align="justify">
The Caracas Stock Exchange also forms part of the Advisory Committee on Latin-American Securities in Euros and Latibex, which began operations in Spain in December.
</p>
<p  align="left">
<b >
Movements of Issuer Firms
</b>
</p>
<p  align="justify">
The following firms joined the list of companies with shares quoted on the Caracas Stock Exchange: Corporación Industrial de Energía C.A., S.A.C.A., Seguros La Seguridad, C.A., Seguros Pan American C.A., and Banco de Caribe S.A.C.A. Banco Universal.
</p>
<p  align="justify">
Shares of the following companies were removed from the trading screens: Banco Mercantil (now Mercantil Servicios Financieros), Maplatex, Tablopán, Luz Eléctrica de Venezuela, Inverseca, Inlaca, Banex, Madosa, and Inversiones Carorore.
</p>
<p  align="left">
Banco Caracas C.A. absorbed Banco Fivenez S.A.C.A. Banco Universal.
</p>
<p  align="left">
BBO Servicios Financieros absorbed Banex Mercado de Capitales.
</p>
<p  align="left">
Corp Banco absorbed the Banco del Orinoco.
</p>
<p  align="justify">
Inversiones Selva notified the Exchange of signing an agreement to form a strategic association through incorporation of a new company called Holding Phoenix Capital LTD.

Volume of Trades
</b>
</p>
<p  align="justify">
Beginning in January the number of trades significantly decreased, reaching levels much below those of the prior year and continuing in this manner throughout the gear, with a rise in April and May, but closing with a very low daily average (257 trades) in the fourth quarter, with December being the poorest month of the year (205 trades). The average for the year was 370 trades daily, a decrease of 32.98% in relation to 1998 (552 trades daily).

Stock Market Index and Market Capitalization
</b>
</p>
<p  align="justify">
Due to less demand, the stock market continued being a sellers market. High interest rates and contraction in internal demand brought about a substantial shrinkage in company results. The combination of these factors failed to achieve recuperation in share prices, which were below 1998 by 44.60%. Nevertheless, the IBC went from 4,788.68 points on December 31, 1998 to 5,418.01 points on December 30, 1999, closing dates of these years, which represented an increase of 13.4%.

As a consequence of the drop in prices of company shares, Stock Market Capitalization was also affected, in bolivars as well as dollars.

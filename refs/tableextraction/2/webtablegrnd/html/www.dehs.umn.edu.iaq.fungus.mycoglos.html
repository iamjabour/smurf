Mycological Aspects of Indoor Air Quality

Fungal interpretation
</h3>
<p >
Initially a walk through evaluation is made to attempt to identify potential sources of fungal amplification. Fungi need a source of moisture, a source of carbon, and proper temperature. Because fungi grow well at room temperature, control is achieved through adequate filtration and control of moisture. Areas which have poor filtration and a source of moisture are likely to be sources for fungal amplification.
</p>
<p >
A walk through investigation will look for possible sources for fungal amplification. These include: visible filamentous fungal growth, water damage, poor housekeeping, poor ventilation, and inadequate filtration.
</p>
<p >
Bulk samples are taken from the suspect material. These may be swab samples, bulk dilution samples, or Rodac plate samples. For duct insulation, the following numbers are rough rules of thumb used to assess fungal contamination using a dilution sample.

The organisms present in the sample have a bearing on whether or not an area is considered a problem.

Interpretation of Results
</b>
<p >
Attempts to link bulk sources to airborne concentrations of fungal organisms are often problematic. The levels of fungal organisms vary by several orders of magnitude during the course of a day due to activity levels in an area and other factors such as fluctuations in temperature or humidity which cause the release of spores. The spores may no longer be viable and though allergenic and possibly toxigenic it will not grow on any media. Rapidly growing fungi may crowd out slower growing fungi. The wrong media may be used for viable sampling.
</p>
<p >
There are at present no strict numerical guidelines which are appropriate for assessing whether the contamination in an area is acceptable or not. Further investigation of contamination sources is warranted in the following circumstances.
</p>
<ol >
<li  type="1">
<p >
Total indoor counts are greater than outdoor fungal counts (compare indoor and outdoor ratios). This comparison is not valid when the outdoor sample was taken during or immediately after precipitation. It probably is not valid during some winter months where outdoor fungal counts are usually below that indoors.
</p>
</li>
<li  type="1">
Comparison of indoor and outdoor levels of fungal organisms show one of the following:
<ol  type="A">
<li  type="A">
Organisms are present in the indoor sample and not in the outdoor sample.
</li>
<li  type="A">
The predominant organism found in the indoor sample is different than the predominant organism in the outdoor sample.
</li>
<li  type="A">
A monoculture of an organism is found in the indoor sample. The organism may be present in a mixed outdoor sample. It may be absent from samples taken in other areas of the building.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li  type="1">
<p >
If the criteria in #2 are met and the organism is capable of producing a carcinogen (e.g., aflatoxin produced by Aspergillus flavus). The spores may be toxic by inhalation (e.g., satratoxin H in the case of Stachybotrys atra). The production of the toxin is very dependent on the source of nutrition for the organism.
</p>
</li>
<li  type="1">
<p >
In some cases, to comply with the American's With Disabilities Act, efforts will be taken to further reduce levels even though they are not identified as a problem in section 1, 2 and 3. This would be the case where an individual has been diagnosed by a physician to be allergic to a specific fungal organism. Efforts may then be made to further reduce exposure through increase filtration of the air. There are often problems linking an environmental exposure to an allergy test. The antigenic material produced by a fungus of a particular genus will vary according to species or a strain within the species and vary with the source of nutrition for the organism. Other factors also influence the antigenicity of the fungal spore. Thus, establishing a direct link between environmental exposure and the results of an allergy test is often problematic. Removal of the person from the area is often the most successful approach.

An opportunistic fungal pathogen is found in an area which houses individuals who are immune compromised.

ggressive sampling and sampling of suspected sources of fungal organisms is often warranted. The amount of fungi present in an air sample is highly variable. Changes in airflow, humidity, light level and temperature can all trigger a spore release. A single air sample will often underestimate the fungal contamination in the air.
</p>
</li>

A general rule of thumb:
</p>
<p ></p>
<ol  type="A">
<li  type="A">
If the numbers are high (air or bulk)
</li>
<li  type="A">
Fungi indoors are different from outdoors or noncomplaint controls

<li  type="A">
The fungi are allergenic or toxic,
</li>
<li  type="A">
The area is likely to be disturbed,
</li>
<li  type="A">
There is or was a source of water or high relative humidity, and
</li>
<li  type="A">

<li  type="A">

</li>
<li  type="A">

</li>
</ol>
<p >
<b >
Note:
</b>
If A through G are not true, then there probably is not a fungal related problem.

The preceding guidelines are not meant to be all inclusive but should aide in interpreting the sampling results. The findings listed for each group, genera or species represent a document in progress.

<a  name="rotation">
Over the last few years
</a>
we have witnessed a dramatic shift in rotation practices on farms across eastern Canada. Instead of the more traditional rotation involving corn, soybeans and wheat, many farmers are growing soybeans on soybeans. Poor weather both at corn planting and harvest time, strong soybean commodity prices, and some misconceptions about the profitability of corn and wheat, have all contributed to this trend.
</font>
</small>
</p>
<p >
<small >
<font  face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,Geneva">
The long term costs of growing soybeans for three, four or even more years in a row significantly outweigh any short-term benefits. A restricted crop rotation -- such as soybeans on soybeans -- harms soil structure and fertility, increases pest pressures and ultimately reduces yield.
</font>
</small>
</p>
<p >
<small >
<font  face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,Geneva">
A good crop rotation strategy, on the other hand, has a positive impact on these factors. Rotation also shifts the focus from measuring success or profitability solely in terms of individual crop yield to a production system that delivers equal or greater profit through improved crop returns.

A crop production system is composed of all of the choices a producer makes to grow a crop and ensure a profit ? such as tillage method, soil fertility levels, variety selection, crop rotation, and disease, insect and weed management strategies. As in any other management system, changes to one component impact the entire system.

Each producer develops a unique crop production system that meets their farm?s challenges and opportunities. But there are best management practices that should be part of every system, no matter where you farm.

<font  face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,Geneva">
A well-structured soil is the starting point for any crop production system. Soil with a healthy structure promotes seed germination and plant growth; minimizes erosion, crusting and compaction; and enhances drainage.
</font>
</small>
</p>
<p >
<small >
<font  face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,Geneva">
Each soil type is made up of varying amounts of sand, silt, clay and organic matter. Soil texture is determined by the proportion of sand, silt and clay in the soil, while soil structure describes how the mineral and organic particles fit together to form clumps or soil aggregates.
</font>
</small>
</p>
<p >
<small >
<font  face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,Geneva">
Good soil structure relies on high levels of organic matter because it is the organic matter that provides glue-like substances that act to stick individual particles together to form clumps or stable aggregates.
</font>
</small>
</p>
<p >
<small >
<font  face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,Geneva">
The level of organic matter also determines how air and water move through the soil and its susceptibility to erosion by wind and water.
</font>
</small>
</p>
<p >
<small >
<font  face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,Geneva">
Crop rotations that include legumes and grasses help to maintain and build organic matter levels within the soil. Soil structure can be improved by adding more organic matter such as animal manure, green manure (plowdown crops) or the stubble and root residues of current crops.
</font>
</small>
</p>
<p >
<small >
<font  face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,Geneva">
Research carried out by Dr. Tony Vyn, former cropping systems specialist at the University of Guelph, shows that the structure of soils in corn-soybean rotations can actually be poorer than soils which are in continuous corn production. Vyn measured erosion levels on plots in Elora, Ontario following an intense June rainstorm in 1994. He found that the rate of erosion in first year soybeans was twice as high as with other rotations, regardless of tillage system. The higher rate of erosion was partly due to reduced soil porosity, or the soil?s ability to soak up water. If rainwater isn?t absorbed by the soil, it either runs off carrying valuable topsoil and nutrients with it or forms yield-reducing ponds ? reducing crop productivity, particularly in years of weather-related stress.

Effective Pest Management

<p >
<small >
<font  face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,Geneva">
Pest management includes the control of weeds, insects or diseases that compete with a crop and restrict its growth. The best pest management strategy begins with measures designed to optimize crop health because a healthy, well-fed plant is better able to fight off pests.
</font>
</small>
</p>
<p >
<small >
<font  face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,Geneva">
Field crops are susceptible to thousands of different diseases. While some plant diseases are caused by environmental factors such as nutrient deficiencies, temperature, soil moisture, light, soil pH and herbicide injury, the majority of plant diseases are caused by micro-organisms or pathogens such as fungi, bacteria, nematodes and viruses.
</font>
</small>
</p>
<p >
<small >
<font  face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,Geneva">
Diseases can?t occur without plants and pathogens coming together under suitable environmental conditions ? it?s the most significant determining factor for plant diseases. And continuous production of a single crop actually encourages the disease cycle by providing opportunities for the pathogen to reproduce and infect next year?s crop. The level of infection accelerates the longer the same crop is grown in succession. The consequences are increased production costs ? as pests are controlled -- and decreased yields.
</font>
</small>
</p>
<p >
<small >
<font  face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,Geneva">
Crop rotation is one of the most cost-efficient means of reducing pests. The disease cycle is broken by planting a non-susceptible crop into the residue of a host crop. The longer the break between similar crops, the less opportunity for disease to establish.

The Nematode Threat

<font  face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,Geneva">
Producers in western Ontario are beginning to experience some of the negative effects of continuous soybeans as the disease pressure from soybean cyst nematode (SCN) and white mold begins to limit yields. There is also an increase in the incidence of Phytophthora root rot, Rhizoctonia root rot and sudden death syndrome. One of the main reasons for the proliferation of these pests is reduced crop rotation.
</font>
</small>
</p>
<p >
<small >
<font  face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,Geneva">
Cyst nematodes are small microscopic parasites that feed on soybean roots, interrupting normal plant growth, reducing nodule development and opening the way to root rotting organisms. The presence of SCN was first reported in Ontario in 1987 and has since spread to seven southwestern counties.
</font>
</small>
</p>
<p >
<small >
<font  face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,Geneva">
Yield losses can be 20 percent or higher, depending on variety, soil type and moisture stress.
</font>
</small>
</p>
<p >
<small >
<font  face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,Geneva">
The good news is that SCN cannot mature and reproduce in fields where soybeans are not grown. And in the years when non-host crops such as alfalfa and corn are grown, SCN population densities decline as much as 50 percent.
</font>
</small>
</p>
<p >
<small >
<font  face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,Geneva">
Since SCN is virtually impossible to eradicate once present in a field, prevention is a critical management strategy. However, the pest can be managed with the following practices:
</font>
</small>
</p>
<ul >
<li >
<small >
<font  face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,Geneva">
thorough equipment cleaning with high pressure water or steam to remove all soil particles before moving to an uninfested field,

planting high-yielding SCN-resistant soybean varieties.
</font>
</small>
</li>
</ul>
<p >
<small >
<font  face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,Geneva">
Although the use of resistant varieties is an effective strategy for managing SCN, resistant varieties should not be grown continuously because of the danger of a SCN population (or race) developing that is capable of reproducing on the resistant varieties. This has already occurred in southwestern Ontario.
</font>
</small>
</p>
<p >
<small >
<font  face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,Geneva">
All SCN-resistant soybean varieties to date have been developed from the same genetic base, resulting in a significant, but localized, problem with the development and spread of a new race dubbed Race 1. Industry and government experts agree that in some areas of the province, populations of Race 1 SCN are reaching damaging levels.
</font>
</small>
</p>
<p >
<small >
<font  face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,Geneva">
If the level of SCN infestation in a field is low, Albert Tenuta, integrated pest management specialist with Ridgetown College, University of Guelph, recommends that Ontario producers implement a rotation that alternates resistant and susceptible soybean varieties with non-host crops. In high risk situations, two years of non-host crops separating alternating years of resistant and susceptible soybean varieties are recommended.

Soybean crops throughout Ontario are also facing a rising problem with white mold ? due in part, again, to the increasing frequency of soybeans in rotations. The disease is caused by air-borne sclerotia spores that are very resistant to decay. Research carried out at the University of Guelph indicated that white mold can be managed by rotating soybeans with a non-host crop such as wheat or corn ? and practicing no-till because sclerotia loses its viability faster when left on the soil surface than when buried by tillage.

Producers need effective, economical methods of dealing with pests and diseases that limit crop yields. Crop rotation is one such tool because it reduces the potential for serious reinfestations due to one specific crop residue.

<small >
<font  face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,Geneva">
A sound crop rotation enhances weed control options and efficacy. For example, the population of weeds not controlled by soybean herbicides will increase exponentially the longer weeds are left untreated. The watershed year -- the year that weed populations break -- is generally assumed to be the third year into successive plantings of the same crop. Rotation to a different crop, and a different herbicide group, will ensure a more effective weed management program.
</font>

</p>
<p >

<font  face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,Geneva">
Yield is affected by many factors -- soil fertility, soil type, drainage, weather, crop genetics and farm management. The best way to improve yields may vary from field to field and even within one field.
</font>
</small>
</p>
<p >
<small >
<font  face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,Geneva">
And research clearly indicates that a sound rotation can improve yields for all crops by up to 15 percent ? on top of improving soil structure and strengthening pest management programs.

In Ontario, the best yield improvements are achieved with a rotation of soybeans, wheat and corn. Yields can be improved even further when winter wheat is underseeded with red clover.

The benefits of including wheat in a rotation become more apparent over time. Research is beginning to quantify how many more bushels you can harvest with wheat in the rotation. And if the wheat is underseeded with red clover, the improved soil structure will increase both corn and soybean yields, adding even more profit to the bottom line.
</font>
</small>
</p>
<p >
<small >
<font  face="Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,Geneva">
Although wheat will improve the structure of any soil, clay soils respond the best to a rotation that includes wheat. And while research demonstrates that good loam soils may show less yield advantage with wheat, the response is tremendous in a stress year.

A substantial reduction in soil loss is another advantage to crop rotation. Research indicates that growing wheat underseeded to red clover one year in four reduces soil erosion by 75 percent compared to a corn-soybean rotation. Correctly calculating and taking advantage of the benefits of a good rotation can improve the bottom line by lowering the cost of production. The nitrogen credit to the red clover is often as high as 80 lb/acre in the first year, and 25 lb/acre in the second. Total nitrogen credit from red clover, soybeans and manure should all be factored into fertility requirements, reducing the required amount of applied nitrogen.

Forages Round Out a Rotation

Working forages, like alfalfa, into your corn-soybean-wheat rotation will provide many additional benefits to crop production. Forages improve soil structure, provide increased erosion control and help achieve the optimum number of years between crops.

The root structure of forages is finer so the roots break down more easily allowing air into the soil. When air and moisture move more freely through soil, crops can make the most of moisture and nutrients.

Forages provide good ground cover throughout the season, helping keep soil in place. And because forages improve soil structure, rain soaks into the ground and doesn?t run off. The addition of forages into a rotation also makes it possible to allow the recommended number of years between crops. For example, on any given field, corn and wheat should be grown one in every three years and oilseeds one in every four years for maximum disease and pest control.

Radial
</strong>
- provides local service to the central business district and travels along most major streets. Bus lines 1 through 99 with the exception of lines listed below as limited stop and express are considered radial lines.
</li>
</ul>
<ul >

Limited stop
</strong>
- used primarily to reduce loads on local service and provide shorter travel time for longer trips. These lines follow the same route as a local line service these but only stop at high activity or transfer bus stops. Presently VIA operates twelve limited stop routes (3, 10, 21, 38, 31, 52, 76, 81, 87, 91, 550, and 551).

- provides non-stop service between major transit generators, park and ride facilities, and transfer centers. In order to provide customers the shortest travel time, the majority of the express line is operated on expressways. Presently VIA operates five express routes (17, 64, 65, 93, and 94).

DRAFT - SUMMARY OF SURVEY RESULTS
</h2>
<h2 >
(NATO/CCMS Pilot Study on Environmental Aspects of Reusing Former Military Lands, Subgroup III)
</h2>
<h2 >
7 September 1995
</h2>
<h3 >
Background
</h3>
A primary responsibility of Subgroup III (Analytical Information Support) is to provide a central repository for the data gathered in the course of the pilot study. The Internet-based World Wide Web (WWW) NATO/CCMS Clearing House System (CHS), is presently under development for NATO by the Institute for Defense Analyses. The CHS will be used to support the sharing and exchange of information among the study's participants. The Subgroup is also supporting the Pilot Study as the test user group to identify the initial functionality required of the CHS to be useful to the other NATO/CCMS pilot studies.
<p >
The CHS development effort focuses on the system's server, including the acquisition of the hardware and software, initial identifications and configuration of information to be posted on the system, and the testing and demonstration of system access (e.g., via Internet, modem), and the associated capabilities. Computer systems at user (client) sites and user access to the server are the responsibility of the users. Anticipating variations among the Pilot Study's participating nations in computer and communications availability and capability, Subgroup III has undertaken a survey to obtain some insight into the participants' existing equipment availability and the desired information support capability. This paper describes the overall survey and summarizes the results.
</p>
<h3 >
The Questionnaire and Survey
</h3>
Subgroup III's overall survey includes a user questionnaire and a survey form, shown in Attachments A and B, respectively. The questionnaire was designed to identify the current availability of computer equipment as well as the communications connectivity and level of service for the participating nations. The survey form was intended to solicit input from the participants about areas of interest in terms of information type as well as system capability. The survey form listed 7 categories of information, to which the respondents were asked to indicate their interests. The categories include: (1) pilot study reports, (2) other environmental databases, (3) e-mail capability, (4) publications, (5) training, (6) partnership with government, academic institutions, industry, etc., and (7) information on financial sources. The respondents were also asked to indicate the specific types of environmental information and publications of particular interest to them.
<p >
The questionnaire and survey were prepared for the 19 Executive Members of the Pilot Study, listed Appendix C. A total of 17 Executive Members were successfully reached: 15 via facsimile on 10 and 13 March 1995, and 2 hand delivered at the last Pilot Study meeting the week of 9 May 1995 in Garmisch, Germany. Of these, responses have thus far been received from 12 participating countries. On 9 and 10 August 1995, the survey forms were retransmitted to those who had not yet responded. No additional responses have been received from this latest contact.
</p>
<p >
It should be noted that the results reported here are based on those participants who have responded to the survey, but do not necessarily represent the other participating countries. Nevertheless, the results should still be meaningful and useful so long as they are regarded as additional understanding or insight rather than rigorous statistics.
</p>
<h3 >
Summary of Findings
</h3>
This section of the report summarizes the results from the survey. Further details are provided in the next two sections. The main findings are as follows:
<ul  type="round">
<li  type="round">
Three-quarters of the participating nations that have responded to the questionnaire possess Personal Computers (PCs) of the 386- and 486-generation.
</li>
<li  type="round">
Three-quarters have relatively modern communications modems (i.e., with speeds of 9.6 kbps or higher.)
</li>
<li  type="round">
Slightly over one-half reported having access to the Internet.
</li>
<li  type="round">
In all, 3 of the 12 respondents have no Internet access nor at least a 9.6 kbps modem.
</li>
</ul>
These findings are generally encouraging. However, successful participation in the CHS depends on ready access to a computer and telecommunications connectivity, and reasonably high quality communications links to support high speed data traffic. It should also be remembered that the above results do not reflect the 37% of the participating countries that have not yet responded to the questionnaire. Some of them might not have sufficient equipment.
<p >
The survey reveals a consensus among the respondents in terms of the type of information and bulletin board services needed. The desired information includes contamination databases; cleanup technologies; potential funding sources; and the U.S. Departement of Energy (DOE), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Library of Congress databases. The types of services desired from the CHS include:
</p>
<ul  type="round">
<li  type="round">
Ready access to pilot study reports.
</li>
<li  type="round">
Search for other existing databases and publications.
</li>
<li  type="round">
E-mail capabilities.
</li>
<li  type="round">
Means to foster partnerships among governments.
</li>
</ul>
This consensus can be used to prioritize data collection and identification of information source efforts for the CHS.
<p >
While the survey and questionnaire have provided useful insight, the importance of the usersí having the necessary computer and access to telecommunications connectivity cannot be over-emphasized. It is recommended that the pilot study consider the following:
</p>
<ol >
<li >
Continue to request input from those participating nations that have not responded to the survey.
</li>
<li >
Urge all participating countries to acquire the necessary computer, modem, and connectivity or identify anticipated shortfalls
</li>
</ol>
<h3 >
Questionnaire Results
</h3>
Table 1 depicts the results from the first part of the survey -- the user questionnaire -- that focuses on existing equipment and communications connectivity capability. The data contained in the chart are based on the 12 completed questionnaires, or approximately 63% of those surveyed.

The table shows that 75% of the respondents already have 486- or 386-based personal computers. Fifty percent have 14.4 kbps or 28.8 kbps modems. Fifty-eight percent have access to the Internet. Although not shown in the table, two of the five without Internet access are equipped with 9.6 or higher modems.

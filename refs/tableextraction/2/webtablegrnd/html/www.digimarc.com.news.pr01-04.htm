Digimarc Corporation Reports Record Fourth Quarter and Year-End Results
</font>
</h3>
<p >
<b >
PORTLAND, Ore., February 7, 2001
</b>
- Digimarc Corporation (NASDAQ: DMRC), the world leader in digital watermark technology and applications, today announced record revenues of $3.4 million for its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2000.
</p>
<p >
Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2000 were $3.4 million, resulting in a 25 percent increase over the $2.7 million of revenues in the comparable period of 1999. Net loss per share for the fourth quarter of 2000 was $(0.19) based on 15.54 million weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding for the quarter which was significantly smaller than the net loss per share of $(0.30) based on 5.14 million weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding for the comparable period of 1999.
</p>
<p >
Revenues for the year ending December 31, 2000 were a record $11.9 million, resulting in a 71 percent increase over the $6.9 million of revenues for the year ending December 31, 1999. Net loss per share for the year ending December 31, 2000 was $(1.17) based on 13.57 million weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding for the year, compared to a net loss per share of $(0.78) based on 3.05 million weighted average basic and diluted shares for the year ending December 31, 1999.
</p>
<p >
"In Q4 we continued progress toward our goal of making our technology a standard feature of all media content. The combination of continuing revenue growth and effective management of expenses contributed to strong earnings per share performance that exceeded analysts' consensus," said Bruce Davis, Digimarc's president and CEO. "Our platform strategy is focused on creating and fostering the deployment of valuable applications with powerful customers and other business partners that will drive ubiquitous adoption of digital watermarking."
</p>
<p >
"Highlights of year-end include the announcement of a $60 million strategic investment from industry leaders Philips and Macrovision, a joint venture with Philips to develop and market new video and audio applications, and new media commerce partnerships with Alchemedia and Replacements.com. We also received seven new U.S. patents and filed 120 new U.S. applications which brings our portfolio up to 22 U.S. patents granted and 176 pending," Davis said.
</p>
<p >
Davis continued, "In late 2000, we introduced Digimarc MediaBridge to the commercial printing market and began generating our first revenues from this segment. Intelligencer, our first licensee, is one of the largest direct-mail printers in the country. Also, Printer, Buyers and Brokerage Association International, the largest printing industry association, has signed a reseller agreement that targets small and mid size printers. Although we saw fewer Digimarc MediaBridge marked magazine ads than initially anticipated, Internet-enabled ads have appeared in numerous national publications including Wired, Popular Mechanics, Smart Money, Good Housekeeping, Entertainment Weekly, Seventeen and Expedia Travel."
</p>
<p >
"In 2000, our Secure Documents division made further inroads into the government sector. Digimarc has partnered with Logicon to offer Digimarc's ID mark solution as part of their Smart Card proposals to leading U.S. government departments and agencies and Emergent Information Technologies is adapting our technology for use by intelligence and defense agencies." Digimarc will hold its Q4 2000 and year-end December 31, 2000 earnings conference call today, beginning at 5:00 p.m. EST. The call will feature Bruce Davis, president and CEO and E.K. Ranjit, chief financial officer.

This release and the call contain forward-looking statements that are subject to certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Although Digimarc Corporation believes that the expectations reflected in its forward-looking statements, including our comments about our expectations for future sales and expenses, are reasonable, actual results could differ materially from those expectations because of certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties, including market acceptance of our technology and digital watermark applications; the loss of important customers or business partners; unsuccessful implementation of our product solutions by our partners; difficulties managing our planned growth, including our joint venture; and the volatility of share prices for companies in our industry and the effect of those prices or other events beyond Digimarc Corporation's control, including adverse changes in general economic conditions. Important cautionary statements and risk factors that would affect actual results are discussed in materials filed by Digimarc Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission over the past twelve months, including without limitation, Digimarc Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 28, 2000 and the most recent filed Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed on November 14, 2000.

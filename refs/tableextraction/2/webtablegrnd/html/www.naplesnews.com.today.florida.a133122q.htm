MIAMI - Cigarette makers have cherry-picked and distorted research to confuse smokers about the product's dangers and prevent them from quitting, according to testimony in a landmark smoking trial.
</p>
<p >
"My concern is a systematic abuse of data for corporate purposes," Dr. John Holbrook, a former contributor to the surgeon general's report on the health risks of smoking, said in a deposition presented Tuesday.
</p>
<p >
The trial, which began Oct. 19, is nearing the end of the presentation by plaintiffs' attorney Stanley Rosenblatt. The suit, which represents an estimated 500,000 Florida smokers, says smokers were deceived about a habit that made them sick and seeks at least $200 billion in damages.
</p>
<p >
The defendants, which include Philip Morris Inc. and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., say the risks of smoking have been well known for years and anyone who takes up the habit makes an informed choice.
</p>
<p >
Plaintiffs' attorneys on Tuesday read testimony by Holbrook, who teaches at the University of Utah medical school and contributed to surgeons' general reports on smoking from 1971 to 1989. For 20 years, he has written the chapter on smoking in a widely used medical textbook.
</p>
<p >
In his testimony, taken in 1997, Holbrook mentioned a newspaper ad placed by the industry that quoted the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial, a 20-year, $100 million study by the Public Health Service.
</p>
<p >
In the MRFIT, 12,000 people were divided into two groups - one that got regular health care and another which was counseled about risk factors for coronary disease, including smoking.
</p>
<p >
The industry seized on a finding that there was no significant difference in death rates between the two groups. But the trial also showed, as had previous studies, that smokers had a 70 percent higher risk of heart disease, according to Richard Kluger's history of the U.S. cigarette industry, "Ashes to Ashes."
</p>
<p >
Holbrook called the industry spin "a blatant attempt to misrepresent the content of this study."
</p>
<p >
As medical director of the National Clearinghouse on Smoking and Health, Holbrook held ultimate responsibility for the 1972 surgeon general's report.
</p>
<p >
"I have seen attempts to distort and misrepresent the contents of these reports over many years," he said, describing how the industry would "take sentences out of context from the conclusion, with neither the information before it or the information after, and use it."
</p>
<p >
But beyond the MRFIT ad, he offered few specifics.
</p>
<p >
He testified about a telephone call he received from a representative of either Philip Morris or R.J. Reynolds - he couldn't remember which - who offered "significant" support for his research.
</p>
<p >
"After a few minutes I was frankly offended," said Holbrook, who stays abreast of smoking and health issues to keep his chapter current but doesn't conduct experiments. "I told them what I thought of their corporate policies and that ended the conversation."
</p>
<p >
Circuit Judge Robert Kaye told jurors on Tuesday not to return until Feb. 22 so lawyers can argue whether certain tobacco-related documents should be admitted.
</p>
<p >
Other defendants in the first class-action suit by smokers to reach trial include Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., Lorillard Tobacco Co., Liggett Group Inc., and Miami's Dosal Tobacco Corp., as well as the Council for Tobacco Research and the Tobacco Institute.

Why Does the Bank Support Figure Skating?
</b>
</font>
</p>
<p >
<font  face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">
Figure skating enjoys a special cultural significance to Canadians and Bank of Montreal is proud to support this enduring national pastime. In a country noted for its regional diversity, figure skating is a common denominator. More than six million Canadians - almost 25% of the national population - are involved in this aesthetically graceful sport. Today, interest in figure skating is at an all-time high in Canada. This year's Canadian Championships are forecast to be one of the most competitive and, by far, the most widely-watched ever.

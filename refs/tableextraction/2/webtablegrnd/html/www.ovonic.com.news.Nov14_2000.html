TROY, Mich.
</b>
, Nov. 14, 2000 -- Energy Conversion Devices, Inc. (ECD) (NASDAQ:ENER) announced today a significant improvement in its operating results. Revenues increased 33.7% to $10,134,000 compared to $7,580,000 in the first quarter last year. Similarly, the Company's net loss of $1,745,000 was a $2,000,000 improvement compared to the same quarter last year. On a per-share basis, the loss was $.09 in 2000 compared to a loss of $.28 in 1999.
<p >
In a joint statement, Stanford R. Ovshinsky, President and CEO, and Robert C. Stempel, Chairman, said, "We're very pleased to see the tangible improvement in our operating results. Our technologies and products have entered a new stage of acceptance and growth in both energy and information, and our new strategic alliances will allow us to greatly accelerate the commercialization of our products." They further noted that revenue growth is expected to continue based on agreements and orders in hand for commercial products, product development and large-scale machine building.
</p>
<p >
The improved performance is a direct result of a fundamental restructuring of the Company. Strategic alliances formed over the last year resulted in our business partners funding the development and commercialization of our products, costs that we shouldered on our own in the past. The alliances include those with Texaco Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Texaco Energy Systems, Inc. (TESI); Intel Corporation; General Electric; N.V. Bekaert S.A.; and China’s Rare Earth High Tech Co., Ltd. of Baotou Steel Company.
</p>
<p >
The agreements have not only brought our cash reserves to over $90 million, but will have a significant positive impact on future cash flows and operations. As part of its long-standing strategy, the Company has made investments in its technologies which have resulted in enabling intellectual property and products. Since June 30, 2000, we have entered into the following agreements:

We have continued to make investments to further advance our technologies which have led to historic new strategic alliances over the past nine months as noted above. According to generally accepted accounting principles as practiced in the United States (GAAP), we were required to report these investments as losses.
</p>
<p >
The Company had a net loss in the three months ended September 30, 2000 of $1,745,000 compared to a net loss of $3,745,000 for the three months ended September 30, 1999. The improvement resulted primarily from increased product sales and increased revenues from product development agreements, partially offset by increased expenses.
</p>
<p >
Product sales, consisting of photovoltaics, machine building, battery packs and positive and negative battery electrodes, increased 71% to $3,192,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2000 from $1,870,000 in the three months ended September 30, 1999. Photovoltaic sales were $1,381,000 in 2000 versus zero in 1999 (United Solar financial statements were consolidated effective April 11, 2000). Machine-building revenues increased to $1,563,000 in 2000 compared to $728,000 in 1999. The machine-building revenues in 2000 were applicable to contracts to build a 25MW annual capacity production equipment for Bekaert ECD Solar Systems and for equipment for the manufacture of NiMH batteries for the Rare Earth Ovonic joint ventures. Sales of negative and positive electrodes decreased $520,000, primarily due to one of the Company’s principal negative electrode licensees currently manufacturing its own electrode products as allowed under its license from the Company. The Company has continued its development of advanced electrode materials to be introduced to its customers. Because most battery pack orders are being filled through GM Ovonic, the Company’s battery pack sales decreased to $178,000 in 2000 versus $553,000 in 1999.
</p>
<p >
Royalties increased 32% to $876,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2000 from $663,000 in the three months ended September 30, 1999, primarily from royalties for battery technologies.
</p>
<p >
Revenues from product development agreements, primarily related to the Company’s enabling technologies in NiMH batteries and hydrogen systems, increased 30% to $5,093,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2000 from $3,918,000 in the three months ended September 30, 1999. There were total increases in product development agreements of $3,014,000 which were due to development programs in 2000 for Texaco Ovonic Fuel Cell ($897,000), Texaco Ovonic Hydrogen Systems ($1,440,000) and United Solar ($677,000), partially offset by the successful conclusion of programs with General Motors to develop batteries for electric and hybrid electric vehicle applications ($0 in 2000 compared to $1,003,000 in 1999), other hydrogen programs ($0 in 2000 compared to $313,000 in 1999), and decreases in programs with Department of Energy and National Renewable Energy Laboratory ($444,000 in 2000 compared to $986,000 in 1999) and National Institute of Standards and Technology in the Company’s battery and optical memory technologies ($660,000 in 2000 compared to $1,275,000 in 1999).
</p>
<p >
Revenues from license and other agreements decreased to $300,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2000 from $400,000 in the three months ended September 30, 1999. The 2000 revenues consisted of agreements with two Chinese companies ($250,000 from BYD Battery Co., Ltd. and $50,000 from SANIK Battery Co., Ltd.).
</p>
<p >
Other revenues decreased by $56,000 to $673,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2000 from $729,000 in the three months ended September 30, 1999, primarily due to decreased billings for work performed for Ovonyx, Inc.
</p>
<p >
The change to other income (net) of $1,348,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2000, from other expense (net) of $311,000 in the three months ended September 30, 1999, was due principally to significantly increased interest income ($1,554,000 in 2000 compared to $226,000 in 1999) in the three months ended September 30, 2000.

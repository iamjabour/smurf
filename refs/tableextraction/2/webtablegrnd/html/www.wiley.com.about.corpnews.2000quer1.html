New York, N.Y., September 2, 1999
</em>
- John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., (NYSE:JWa) (NYSE:JWb), announced today that net income for the first quarter of fiscal year 2000, ended July 31, 1999, advanced 26% to $13.4 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, compared with $10.6 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, in the prior year's first quarter. Revenues for the quarter increased 12% to $137.0 million compared with $122.1 million in the prior year's first quarter. Operating income for the first quarter of $22.6 million was up 32% over the prior year.
</p>
<p >
Revenues and income advanced in all of the company's core businesses-scientific, technical and medical; professional/trade; and educational publishing. The increase in income and margin improvement reflects the combined effect of revenue growth and cost containment. Results in scientific, technical and medical publishing were largely driven by increased journal revenues. Professional/trade benefited from strong demand for backlist titles and the recent acquisition of Jossey-Bass. Educational publishing results included the positive effect of the recent acquisition of certain higher education titles from Pearson. Overall, approximately half of the company's year-to-year revenue increase was attributable to acquisitions completed during the first quarter. After financing costs, these acquisitions had a minimal impact on net income.
</p>
<p >
?The company delivered another quarter of strong results,? said William J. Pesce, President and Chief Executive Officer. ?Revenue growth was healthy and operating margins continued to improve. Our overall strategy of gaining market share in our core businesses by growing organically and through targeted acquisitions, while at the same time improving margins, is working. As announced previously, we strengthened our existing businesses significantly through the acquisition of Jossey-Bass, a San Francisco-based professional publisher, as well as acquiring certain higher education titles from Pearson. These acquisitions were the second and third largest in Wiley's history. We are very positive about the strategic fit between Jossey-Bass and Wiley. Author and customer responses to this acquisition have been encouraging, particularly regarding our strong combined presence in global business publishing. The higher education titles that we acquired have been fully integrated, and we are pleased with the early results. Our college business started the second quarter with a record-setting August, partly due to strong sales of the acquired titles. In both cases, we are tracking well to our acquisition plan.? He continued, ?With respect to our technology initiatives,

, our online journal service which provides full-text access to over 300 journals, continues to receive a favorable market response. We are pleased to have signed some significant, multi-year Enhanced Access Licenses (EAL) with key customers during the quarter. Our EAL provides customers with multi-site access and expanded value-added features.? He concluded by saying, ?Although it's early in the fiscal year, we expect our earnings momentum to continue for the remainder of the year, given existing economic conditions.?

For the
<a  href="http://fts.gsa.gov/" target="_blank">
Federal Technology Service
</a>
(FTS, Fairfax, Va.), a branch of the United States General Services Administration, business is booming. The FTS is the central buying arm of the federal government that helps to procure leading-edge technology products and services for federal agencies and military establishments around the world. As U.S. agencies have downsized their administrative positions in recent years, support demands for the FTS have increased. Its revenues have grown by $1 billion per year over the past three years; it is currently a $5 billion-per-year organization.
</p>
<p >
Now, FTS has decided, is a perfect time to launch a customer relationship management (CRM) initiative.

"We've grown at a staggering rate, without participating much in marketing or advertising," confirms Mary Whitley, assistant commissioner for sales for the FTS. "Now we want to provide our customers with better access to information about our services, our projects and our value-add for these engagements."
</p>
<p >
One of the first tasks of the FTS's CRM team was to communicate to its partners and customers how it would define CRM. Some interpret CRM as simply the addition of Web-based sales or an 800 number. In fact, as the FTS has discerned, CRM is a business strategy that encourages a set of best practices within an organization.

The CRM Potential
</font>
<br ></br>
</b>
Say, "CRM," and most people think, "application suites." But CRM is far more than pieces of software. CRM is first and foremost a strategic goal, outlined by interdepartmental procedures and assisted by technology.
<p >
But why consider CRM? Perhaps your customers are looking for round-the-clock service from multiple channels, including a Web site or call center. Or you want to institute procedures that let you identify best or repeat customers and provide scales of service based on customer value. CRM also may be a way to keep sales and marketing information consistent, from print to Web to telephone.
</p>
<p >
"CRM is a solution that, in spite of the growing size of a company or growing number of contact points with the customer, continues to allow one-to-one contact and personalization of service," says
<a  href="/annual/annual2000/customers/arsenault.asp" target="_blank">
Steve Arsenault
</a>
, worldwide director of CRM for Unisys. "Integrating information can provide a comprehensive view of what each customer values most, provide the sales force with useful information to close deals and improve on customer service, and open new opportunities for one-to-one marketing."

These activities are becoming increasingly critical. The cost of capturing the interest of a first-time customer is increasing, and organizations want to realize that cost through as much repeat business as possible. Additionally, as the Internet enables your organization to reach customers globally, you still need to provide a consistent level of service across geographies in order to protect your brand and reputation. Implementing a CRM solution well can lead to increased customer loyalty, as well as more opportunities for cross-selling and upselling.
</p>
<p >
In the business-to-consumer, or B2C, space, where repeat business is critical to success, businesses often look to CRM to integrate information available from a Web site, print catalog or call center. But industry watchers now recognize that there is an even greater market opportunity for CRM in business-to-business, or B2B, where the deals are larger and the sales force understands who customers and potential customers are. Analyst firm
<a  href="http://www.idc.com" target="_blank">
International Data Corp
</a>
. (Framingham, Mass.) predicts that worldwide CRM services alone will grow 29.5 percent compound annual growth rate from 1999 to 2004, with the highest percentages earned in publishing, financial and manufacturing industries, as well as in communications.
</p>
<p >
New strides in CRM are being made in government-to-citizen, or G2C, in which CRM can aid agencies in quickly viewing data about constituents. "CRM can tie multiple government agencies together," says Pat Giberson, vice president, CRM, for Unisys. "These agencies can interact electronically to understand what the constituent has asked for before, and what other services the constituent has used."
</p>
<p >
In public services, for example, social workers can quickly see what programs a constituent may be eligible for. For businesses, agencies can easily match up companies to appropriate tax laws and licenses. This can improve the quality of service, reduce wait time and reduce the time required for administrative duties, thus making staff more productive.
</p>
<p >
<br ></br>
<b >
<font  face="Arial, Helvetica">
Identifying the Team
</font>
<br ></br>
</b>
Experts say that the first -- and perhaps the most critical -- step in beginning a foray into CRM is to create an interdepartmental team to determine what the organization needs. The team should include representatives from each department that touches the customer throughout his or her relationship with the company.
</p>
<p >
"Think of the customer life cycle within an organization," says Colleen Amuso, research director in the CRM practice of research firm
<a  href="http://www.gartner.com" target="_blank">
Gartner
</a>
(Stamford, Conn.). "The company works to acquire the customer, then works to retain the customer. Then the company works to extend the relationship, through upselling or through other offers to make the customer more loyal. There are several business units within that life cycle. Those units never talk with one another. CRM forces those business units to begin to work together to form strategies and processes that impact the customer relationship. This is one of the most difficult aspects of implementing CRM -- getting the business units to work together toward a common goal."
</p>
<p >
In addition, IT personnel also must be represented, including database architects, data access experts, infrastructure experts, and implementation and integration teams.
</p>
<p >
Another vital participant is a representative from upper management to drive the inevitable changes that will come out of the implementation, advises Giberson of Unisys. While the representative need not be the CEO, it should be someone who has no allegiance to a particular business unit or discipline, is high enough within the organization to effect change, and can secure the budget for CRM personnel, technology and procedures.
</p>
<p >
Members of the team should be prepared for a long-term commitment to the team. "CRM ends up being a series of projects, and they are ongoing," says Amuso.
</p>
<p >
The team's initial tasks are to review how the organization interacts with each customer and determine how to improve and extend the relationship. What type of information does the sales force need to sell more effectively? Do customers often complain that order or form processing takes too much time? Does the organization need a better way to encourage one-time customers to come back? The team must then examine existing processes, to determine what steps are unnecessary or where information disconnects happen.
</p>
<p >
"Any CRM implementation must include a re-engineering of business processes to focus on the customer," affirms Arsenault of Unisys. "Organizations must look carefully at the largest inhibitors in their customer relations, and then determine goals to improve those relations."
</p>
Take the example of the FTS. The FTS knows who its customers are; the list of federal agencies is well-defined. But the FTS wants to add value to the customers it already has and illustrate its value to other agencies. Whitley and her team determined that the most effective way to achieve these goals was to organize all data from FTS sources, which was coming in globally and in different formats, into a single manageable format.
<p >
Analyzing data will enable FTS representatives to determine if other representatives are working on a similar project for another client, and to easily share information for a successful implementation. Representatives also will be able to tell a customer what the FTS is doing for an overseas branch of their agency, to keep initiatives in synch. FTS may be able to suggest new ways that the customer can use the organization's services. Additionally, properly organized data can offer easy access to information about the needs of organizations that are not using the FTS. The FTS can then educate these organizations about its offerings and describe what it can do for each organization's budget and technology needs.
</p>
<p >
"At first, we thought knowledge management was the way to go," states Whitley of the FTS. "But we also needed a methodology for identifying opportunities, qualifying them and having teams work together to bring in new opportunities. We found that CRM is where all of these elements came together."

Integration, Now and Later
</font>
<br ></br>
</b>
CRM solutions from major suppliers can be comprehensive, and small companies sometimes use such solutions out of the box. Larger installations, however, must integrate CRM solutions with the back office, where existing databases and customer information reside. Because of this, and because organizations often want data fields and other aspects of the package specifically tailored to their needs, CRM implementations are often complex. In many instances, it may be best to work with a services provider for parts of the implementation.
</p>
<p >
Determining which parts of an implementation to entrust to a service provider requires a careful look at what skills and technology may be available in-house. "You can't really outsource the business strategy aspects of CRM," states Amuso of Gartner. "You also may not want to outsource the management of your best customers. But other components, which are not part of your core competency and may be better served by a third party, can certainly be outsourced."
</p>
<p >
For example, the FTS is working with Unisys to deploy a commercial, off-the-shelf system from
<a  href="http://www.siebel.com" target="_blank">
Siebel Systems
</a>
(San Mateo, Calif.). Together, the FTS and Unisys are evaluating the business processes and data elements that could help the FTS meet its goals. Unisys has helped analyze existing data fields in the organization's data stores, and is customizing the system to extract meaningful information. The FTS believes that this will be an important step in unifying the activities and knowledge base of its 1,500 employees worldwide.
</p>
<p >
This is not to say there aren't associated risks. "It is critical to work with an integrator that understands the goals and infrastructure of a particular organization and its industry segment, and can integrate the CRM components as a piece of that structure," advises Giberson of Unisys.
</p>
<p >
Equally as important is the ability of the solution to grow with future technology needs of the organization. There was a time when CRM solutions were not integrated with the Internet. Today, such a solution would be useless. But how do you determine what the applications and communications of the future will be, and more important, how do you ensure your organization is ready to make the move?
</p>
<p >
"The CRM solution you implement must address the immediate, basic challenges to your organization first," says Arsenault of Unisys. "However, the solution needs to be flexible enough for your company to continue to expand its customer relationship efforts. While a basic sales force automation solution may solve your needs today, providing an online channel to customers may be a goal for the future. You'll want to make sure these solutions can integrate well in your existing systems, and can talk to one another."
</p>
<p >
<br ></br>
<b >
<font  face="Arial, Helvetica">
Garbage In, Garbage Out
</font>
<br ></br>
</b>
A CRM solution, like any data-driven application, is only as good as the information entered into it. This means that your sales force must use it, and use it well. In some organizations, there may be a cultural resistance to using a CRM system; many may see CRM as an unnecessary administrative step. Organizations must be prepared to face these cultural issues upfront through training and education.
</p>
<p >
"Part of the cultural shift will be driven by upper-level management support and enforcement," says Giberson of Unisys. "But the sales team also needs explanation about the benefits for them when they use the system. That piece is just as critical for encouraging them to use the system and enter strong data."
</p>
<p >
Training should include not just why to use the CRM system, but also what makes up good data and how to retrieve information that is useful. You must also identify a centralized source for ongoing questions about how to enter and retrieve information.
</p>
<p >
For one, Whitley of the FTS believes that CRM will be a driver for positive cultural change that will lead to a set of best practices. "We work in a matrixed organization, where 65 people are working with me in business development functions all over the world," she says. "This will enable us to work together, share information and talk about activities, and strategize next steps and how to bring in new business."
</p>

Determining ROI
</font>
<br ></br>
</b>
Although it is too early to gauge return on investment (ROI) for many CRM projects, and since every organization's size and CRM goals vary, it's difficult to determine an average ROI for CRM projects. However, in surveys of its own customer base, Siebel Systems has found that CRM projects usually pay for themselves within 10 months, and result in a 16 percent increase in revenue and a 21 percent increase in customer satisfaction.
</p>
<p >
The FTS is currently conducting its pilot program, and by the end of the year plans to analyze the results of the pilot and determine an anticipated ROI at that time. This, says Whitley, will be critical to whether or not the organization moves forward with a full CRM implementation.
</p>
<p >
When determining ROI, Giberson of Unisys points out that you must place metrics on customer satisfaction, which directly relates to revenue. "Customer relationships are a source of shareholder value," she says. "In the end, organizations are looking to enhance their competitiveness and grow revenues through better relationships with customers."

QUESTION:

<pre >
Is there any support for 2-part figure and table numbers in Frame?
 
SCENARIO:
The figures in the technical document need to pick up the current 
heading value and append a figure number on the end.
 
For example, the third figure in chapter 2 needs to be labeled:
 		Figure 2.3:
 
The first figure in chapter 4 should be labeled:
  		Figure 4.1:
 
The Frame hotline could not come up with any good ideas other than to 
create a Figure paragraph marker for each chapter in the document. 
This doesn't work well for a document that will be written in 
chapters and pulled together with the book utility.
 
Is there any way to reference the current value of a different 
counter?  The variable definition &lt;$paranum[1Heading]&gt; did not work 
as well.

The workaround is not documented, nor is it wasy to describe.  The 
best way to describe the workaround is by example.
 
In the example below, there are five paragraph formats that require 
the chapter number as part of their numbering. Here are the formats 
with their numbering spec:
 
NAME		EXAMPLE		NUMBERING SPEC
Chapter		Chapter 1&lt;tab&gt;		C:&lt;n+&gt;&lt; =0&gt;&lt; =0&gt;&lt; =0&gt;&lt; =0&gt;\t
Section		Section 1.1&lt;tab&gt;		C:&lt;n&gt;.&lt;n+&gt;&lt; =0&gt;&lt; &gt;&lt; &gt;\t
Section2		Section 1.1.1&lt;tab&gt;		C:&lt;n&gt;.&lt;n&gt;.&lt;n+&gt;&lt; &gt;&lt; &gt;\t
Figure		Figure 1-1&lt;tab&gt;		C:&lt;n&gt;-&lt; &gt;&lt; &gt;&lt;n+&gt;&lt; &gt;\t
Table		Table 1-1&lt;tab&gt;		C:&lt;n&gt;-&lt; &gt;&lt; &gt;&lt; &gt;&lt;n+&gt;\t
 
Notice that all the formats have the same series label (C:), and that 
the series contains five counters. The first counter is used to keep 
track of the chapter, the second to keep track of the section, the 
third to keep track of the section2, the fourth to keep track of the 
figure, and the fifth to keep track of the table.
 
Chapter numbering spec increments the chapter number (&lt;n+&gt;) (which 
assumes that the chapter is part of a book), and resets all the other 
counters to zero (&lt; =0&gt; -- note the space before the equals sign). 
The Section numbering spec increments the section counter (&lt;n+&gt;), 
resets the section2 counter (&lt; =0&gt;), and does nothing with the figure 
and table counters (&lt; &gt;&lt; &gt; -- notice the space within the angle 
brackets).  Section2 is similar to Section, except it increments the 
Section2 counter.  The Figure numbering spec leaves the Section, 
Section2, and Table counters alone, and increments the Figure 
counter.  Table is similar to Figure, except it increments the Table 
counter.
 
Notice that &lt; &gt; and &lt; =0&gt; do not display anything on the page.

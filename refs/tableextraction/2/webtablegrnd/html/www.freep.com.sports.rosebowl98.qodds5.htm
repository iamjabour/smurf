Las Vegas oddsmakers insist Nebraska would be a seven- to 10-point favorite over Michigan.
</p>
<p ></p>
<p >
What does this mean? Not much. Just ask John Avello, race and sports book director at Bally's.
</p>
<p ></p>
<p >
"I would probably open Nebraska as a 10-point favorite in that game," Avello said. "But that doesn't mean Nebraska is a 10-point favorite. It really isn't our job to pick winners, but to put a number up so you will get equal action on the two teams. The best team in the country might be Florida State. They could probably beat Nebraska two out of three times."

For one or two coaches, in the final ESPN/USA Today poll, Michigan wasn't even the country's second-best team.
</p>
<p ></p>
<p >
Nebraska edged Michigan by four points (and two first-place votes), a margin that would have been two points if not for one coach who voted the Wolverines fourth or two coaches who voted them third. Who or whom might have done this could remain a secret forever -- the ESPN/USA Today folks do not reveal their voters or how they vote.
</p>
<p ></p>
<p >
Why did he or they do so? To try to rig the voting so that Nebraska won.
</p>
<p ></p>
<p >
It didn't really affect the outcome. But it certainly taints the entire process.

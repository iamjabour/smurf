</font>
("Metricom") through UUNET Technologies, Inc. ("UUNET") (collectively Metricom and UUNET may be referred to herein as "Provider"). By using Ricochet or by installing and accepting the Ricochet software, Subscriber agrees to these Terms of Use, which includes the license to use Ricochet, the purchase or rental terms for the modem and a disclaimer of warranty. Further, Subscriber agrees to use Ricochet and the modem in a manner consistent with these Terms of Use and with any and all applicable laws and regulations.
<br ></br>
<br ></br>
</li>
<li >
<b >
License to Use Ricochet
</b>
. Subject to these Terms of Use, Subscriber will have a nonexclusive, nontransferable, nonassignable license to use Ricochet. The use of any Ricochet software or documentation related thereto are licensed, not sold, to Subscriber for Subscriber's use only under the terms of the license contained herein, and Metricom reserves any rights not expressly granted to Subscriber. For purposes hereof, "use" means to install Ricochet software in the memory of a computer and to execute any Ricochet software in RAM to access Ricochet.
<br ></br>
<br ></br>
</li>
<li >
<b >
Equipment and Software
</b>
. Subscriber shall use the modem and Subscriber's own equipment to access Ricochet. Subscriber is responsible for all charges for Subscriber's use of any third party services via Ricochet, including any long distance telephone transmission and any information or service provider charges incurred by Subscriber during Subscriber's use of Ricochet that are not part of the Ricochet service Subscriber has selected. PROVIDER SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR DETERMINING COMPATIBILITY BETWEEN EITHER RICOCHET OR THE MODEM AND ANY EQUIPMENT OR SOFTWARE PROVIDED BY SUBSCRIBER AND IN NO WAY WARRANTS THE CAPABILITIES OF ANY SUCH EQUIPMENT OR SOFTWARE IN THE USE OF RICOCHET OR THE MODEM. PROVIDER FURTHER MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES THAT THE MODEM AND RICOCHET, TOGETHER WITH SUBSCRIBER'S EQUIPMENT, WILL ACHIEVE THE MAXIMUM NETWORK ACCESS SPEED SET FORTH IN ANY PROVIDER DOCUMENTATION.
<br ></br>
<br ></br>
</li>
<li >
<b >
Proprietary Rights of Metricom
</b>
. All right, title and interest in Ricochet and the materials included therewith belong to Metricom, except to the extent that third parties whose materials are made available via Ricochet possess copyright or other proprietary interests in such materials. Subscriber will not, by virtue of Subscriber's use of Ricochet, acquire any proprietary interest in Ricochet or of any materials included therewith or accessed thereby.
<br ></br>
<br ></br>
</li>
<li >
<b >
Territorial Limitations
</b>
. Ricochet may only be used in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. Use outside of this territory is prohibited and may violate the export control laws of the United States. Subscriber agrees not to decompile, reverse engineer or disassemble any Ricochet software or the modem. Subscriber agrees not to modify, adapt, translate, incorporate into other works, rent, lease, loan, resell for profit, distribute, network or create derivative works based upon Ricochet, any Ricochet software or any part thereof, the modem, or any manuals or documentation related to Ricochet or the modem. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Subscriber may create client-side applications for Subscriber's internal business purposes that work in conjunction with Ricochet.
<br ></br>
<br ></br>
</li>
<li >
<b >
Limitations on Use
</b>
. Subscriber is solely responsible for Subscriber's content. Provider acts as a passive conduit for Subscriber's online distribution and publication of Subscriber's information. However, Provider reserves the right to take any actions that Provider deems necessary or desirable, including without limitation immediately terminating Subscriber's access rights to Ricochet, if Provider believes that Subscriber's content or materials or use of Ricochet, either alone or in connection with the products or services of others, exceeds any of the limitations set in these Terms of Use or in UUNET's then current Acceptable Use Policy available at
<a  href="/terms/">
www.uu.net/terms
</a>
. Such actions include but are not limited to terminating Subscriber's Ricochet service.
<br ></br>
<br ></br>
Subscriber is solely responsible for the material Subscriber distributes or voluntarily receives while using Ricochet. Any materials Subscriber distributes or voluntarily receives through Subscriber's Ricochet service (a) shall not infringe on any third party's copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary rights or rights of publicity or privacy; (b) shall not violate any law, statute, ordinance or regulation (including without limitation the laws and regulations governing export control); (c) shall not be defamatory, trade libelous, unlawfully threatening or unlawfully harassing; (d) shall not be obscene or contain child pornography or, if otherwise pornographic or indecent, shall be distributed only to people legally permitted to receive such files; (e) shall not violate any laws regarding unfair competition, antidiscrimination or false advertising, (f) shall not impersonate another person with fraudulent or malicious intent, and (g) shall not contain any viruses, trojan horses, worms, time bombs, cancelbots or other computer programming routines that are intended to damage, detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any system, data or personal information. Subscriber may not take any action to the extent that such action that imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure, including, without limitation, using Subscriber's account for web hosting, for remote application server hosting, for streaming application server hosting or for file server hosting.
<br ></br>
<br ></br>
</li>
<li >
<b >
Limitations on Number of Users and Account Usage

<li >
<b >
Limited Warranty and Disclaimer of Warrant
</b>
y. Provider offers no warranties, express or implied, regarding the accuracy, sufficiency or suitability of Ricochet, its software or other Ricochet materials provided to Subscriber.

RICOCHET IS DISTRIBUTED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY WARRANTIES OF TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO SUBSCRIBER. THIS WARRANTY GIVES SUBSCRIBER SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS AND SUBSCRIBER MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE.

<br ></br>
<br ></br>
<b >
(b)
</b>
IN NO EVENT SHALL PROVIDER BE LIABLE TO SUBSCRIBER OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY LOST PROFITS, DATA, SAVINGS OR REVENUES, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER UNDER TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHER THEORIES OF RECOVERY, EVEN IF PROVIDER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. BECAUSE SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO SUBSCRIBER.
<br ></br>
<br ></br>
<b >
(c)
</b>
In no event shall Provider be liable to Subscriber or any third party for any amount in excess of the subscription price actually paid by Subscriber for the most recent year of service, whether under tort, contract, or other theories of recovery.

. Subscriber shall indemnify Provider against liability as well as against claims or demands, or damages, or costs or expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or in connection with Subscriber's breach of any limitation set forth in Sections 5 or 6 of these Terms of Use, or breach of any other provision of these Terms of Use, or Subscriber's violation of any duty imposed by law, or any such breach or violation by any person to whom Subscriber has given Subscriber's password or authorized or permitted to use Subscriber's Ricochet account in any way.
<br ></br>
<br ></br>
</li>
<li >
<b >
Term
</b>

<br ></br>
<br ></br>
</li>
<li >
<b >
Termination
</b>
. Provider reserves the right, at its sole discretion, immediately, without notice, and with or without cause to suspend or terminate Subscriber's access to and use of Ricochet, to delete all information related to Subscriber's Ricochet account upon any breach of the terms and conditions hereof by Subscriber. Either Subscriber or Provider may terminate Subscriber's use of the Ricochet Service at any time without cause by sending notice to the other party.
<br ></br>
<br ></br>
</li>
<li >
<b >
U.S. Government End Users
</b>
. Ricochet is a "commercial item," as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 2.101, consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and is provided to the U.S. Government only as a commercial end item. Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, all U.S. Government end users acquire Ricochet with only those rights set forth herein.

<br ></br>
<br ></br>
</li>
<li >
<b >
Severability
</b>
. Should any provision of these Terms of Use be held by a court of law to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the legality, validity, and enforceability of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Use shall not be affected or impaired thereby.
<br ></br>
<br ></br>
</li>
<li >
<b >
Nonwaiver
</b>
. The failure of any party to enforce any of these Terms of Use, unless waived in writing, shall not constitute a waiver of that party's right to enforce each of these Terms of Use.
<br ></br>
<br ></br>
</li>
<li >
<b >
Entire Agreement
</b>
. These Terms of Use shall constitute the entire agreement between Provider and Subscriber with respect to the subject matter hereof. These Terms of Use supersede all prior discussions, negotiations, or representations by the parties.
